OP	Games Of The Half-Year It's the last day of June, so we're now halfway through 2010. I've played a lot of games in that time. Wouldn't it be fun if I told you about the best games I've played so far this year? Every year I list my games of the year. I did it for 2008 when Far Cry 2 triumphed, I did it for 2009 when Batman: Arkham Asylum came out on top, and I'll be doing it again for this year. Today, however, I won't be listing my games of the half-year in any particular order. I'll leave that for my end of year list. But it will be interesting to see how many of these games end up making that final Games of 2010 list. So, these are the best games I've played this year... so far: Alan Wake Why it will make my Games of 2010 list : It delivered tense combat where you constantly felt threatened and a gripping story that wisely refused to give you all the answers. Plus, the lighting was phenomenal, creating terror whenever you stepped out of the light. Why it won't: Was it really much more than a well-executed third-person shooter packed full of the usual horror genre clichs? BioShock 2 Why it will make my Games of 2010 list: For surpassing expectations. 2K Marin gave us a genuinely worthwhile sequel that improved not only on the original's sandbox combat but also -- yes -- on its story (if not its plot twist). Why it won't: The failure of its multiplayer mode left a sour taste in the mouth. Heavy Rain Why it will make my Games of 2010 list: I love how Quantic Dream are happy to forge their own path and create such utterly unique games. Why it won't: Innovation and originality might not be enough to overcome the flaws in its storytelling. Lost Planet 2 Why it will make my Games of 2010 list: Capcom hooked me through co-op play with objectives and boss battles that demand teamwork, and reeled me in with an addictive unlockables system. Why it won't: I might remember what it was like when I tried to play it on my own. Mass Effect 2 Why it will make my Games of 2010 list: On that final "suicide" mission, BioWare managed to make me feel like a commander who was in charge of a team of real people whose lives were at stake, not just some extra firepower along for the ride. Why it won't: I did miss the bits of RPG that got lost in the journey from original to sequel. Monster Hunter Tri Why it will make my Games of 2010 list: It's everything I wanted from a Monster Hunter game but could never enjoy thanks to the crappy controls of the PSP predecessors. Why it won't: I can't help but think how much more I'd enjoy it in HD and over Xbox LIVE... Red Dead Redemption Why it will make my Games of 2010 list: Rockstar has crafted what is easily, without a shadow of doubt, the most atmospheric poker simulator I've ever played. Why it won't: When I eventually leave the bar, I might find the rest of the game pales in comparison. Redder Why it will make my Games of 2010 list: I'm a sucker for Metroidvania style platforming and this indie effort nails the lonely ambience and complements it with some devious puzzling. Why it won't: Can a free, browser game really compete with all these big-budget commercial releases? Resonance of Fate Why it will make my Games of 2010 list: After the deathgrip of Final Fantasy XIII cut off the blood supply in my hand, it was refreshing to enjoy an RPG that forced you to work things out for yourself. Why it won't: It really was a bit rough around the edges, though. Stalker: Call of Pripyat Why it will make my Games of 2010 list: All three Stalker games have held me in their thrall on atmosphere alone, but this time GSC finally assembled and polished all their ideas into one complete package. Why it won't: I nearly forgot about it when writing this list, so what are the chances I'll remember in another six months? Super Mario Galaxy 2 Why it will make my Games of 2010 list: Playing it this week reminds me of everything I just adore about Nintendo. Why it won't: I didn't stick with the first one, despite loving it for the first week. VVVVVV Why it will make my Games of 2010 list: The perversity of a minimal, rock-hard platformer that looks like it was made for the Commodore 64 appearing in any best of 2010 list does appeal to me. Why it won't: As with Redder, how do I even start to compare this to the rest of the games here? So there's my list. Of course I haven't played every game released this year, which may explain why your favourite missed out. Or perhaps -- just possibly -- I thought your favourite to be a bit rubbish. What would be on your list of the games of the half-year? And what games do you think I really ought to play before compiling my Games of 2010 list at the year's end? I hate to sound like a fanboy, but i haven't actually played any others of the games on this list... *avoids objects being thrown at him* It's mainly because i can't afford the games when they first come out.. but anyway War for Cybertron.. i am absolutely loving this game at the moment - words can't explain how much. I know it's not perfect, or even close - but it's still damn good! David, if you haven't played it yet - give it a whirl - it's quite fun in both single and multi player. :) Personally i would not have had Bioshock 2 or Lost Planet 2 as i found both to be greatly disappointing (LP2 more so - so glad i just rented that one). If i was to fill those two spots, Splinter Cell Conviction would fill one of those, while it is far from GOTY status, it is ONE of the better games i have played this year and i would have also put in Transformers: War for Cybertron (hesitantly as it isn't GOTY material and i have only been playing it for a week, but again i thought it was better then both LP2 and Bioshock 2). It has been a really solid half year so far (the best ever so far?)but for me Mass Effect 2 is my game of the half year by a long margin (may have been less of a margin if i imported Mario Galaxy 2 but i am waiting for release tomorrow). Mass Effect 2 was easily not only my game of the half year but a serious contender for one of my favorite games of all time. However, i agree that a little too many RPG elements were removed but personally i thought were too unbalanced in ME1 (don't get me started on the looting). Hopefully ME3 will strike the right balance. David are we not including the phenomenal Super Street Fighter 4 in the mix ? Is it because you haven't played it? Didn't like it? considered abit of a double dip? or did the Gaga VS Ibuki pic put you off?? ME2 is still currently on top for me and I've noticed I've becoming a DLC junkie this time round. - Alpha Protocol. Yeah it's got flaws but a conversation system that is actually tense and how all those little decisions that actually stack up as the story progresses is a step in the right direction for the RPG genre. - RDR gets a mention but I haven't actually played touched it sine finsihing the single player campaign. Nor do I have the desire to at the moment. Can't get a good multiplayer connection over Xbox Live either. It was a good game but just didn't have that wow factor for me. GOWIII, Heavy Rain, SC:Conviction, Alan Wake (up to ep 5 atm), RDR and Peace Walker. Peace Walker is quite addictive, the only drawback being is that my hands get sore after using the PSP for too long. I suppose GOW Collection as well, even though I played the first one one PS2. Still, I liked the remake. Not to sound like a scratched record (doin' it old school), but my top games would be: -Mass Effect 2 (Was as good as I was expecting- and I was expecting a LOT) -Red Dead Redemption (Was simply one of the most enthralling games I've ever played, and was a huge suprise) -Heavy Rain (Innovative and as good as I was expecting) -Alpha Protocol (If you can get past the intro and the first mission, it's actually very good. I had high expectations for this years ago, then lost interest as it seemingly entered development hell. So it was a pleasant surprise). Worst games so Far: -Final Fantasy 13 (Linear, cliche'd, BORING) -Star Trek Online (Had hopes, but have never been a fan of MMO's, and this one was pinning it's hopes on space combat, which wasn't that great IMHO) I have also managed to get my hands on a copy of "The Precursors", and an unofficial english translation patch. Will be interested to see which list this one ends up on. ME2 and RDR are defenite GOTY contenders. I haven't played Galaxy 2 yet, but nintendo are always strong with mario platformers. I wanted to enjoy Alan Wake, but with it's reliance on story, the cliche and the fact it felt incomplete ruined it for me, possibly due to the prodigious amount of fiction I read. I haven't played the extra content yet, but doubt it will save it. Despite the beauty of the environment and the realism of the lighting, it seems Remedy is saving story for a sequel, and that is disappointing. Dear lord, Bayonetta easily take my game of the year thus far. Everything about it was polished to the nth degree, and even after finishing it 10 times over at least, I can still go back and have an absolute blast. I'd like to see your list for most anticipated games of the last half of the year. In regards to the topic, I'm pretty sure you've got all my favourites (Heavy Rain, RDR) and I can understand why something like MNR may not have made it. Probably between Darksiders and Blur for my GOTY so far. FF13 close. ME2 not quite as good for me as ME1, better combat but much weaker story and most characters just didn't get enough time to develop. I'm almost through Resonance of Fate (off to complete it now) but it won't make the top list. Good game but as you say rough around the edges (just a bit TOO repetitive, from the combat system to rearranging gun parts to the scenery to having to go up and down the f'n elevators ten times an hour due to the arbitrary number of missions you can be on at once, oh, and the arena... ironically, what I found refreshing about FF13 besides the characters was that it IS more direct and linear instead of making you waste time wandering around doing side stuff when you're meant to be doing something more important...) Very tempted to put FIFA World Cup 2010 up there, but I figure FIFA 11 is odds-on to replace it. I'd say FFXIII (Yeah! Haters be damned!) that game ate almost 100 hours of my life in record time, Lost Planet 2 - I still can't see what all the negative feedback was based on, Demon's Souls - omg, it's the most innovative and challenging RPG I've played in a couple of years, and finally Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker on PSP - wihtout a doubt one of the greatest games produced for the console.
NA	Ever since Sam got his soul back in episode 11 of this season's Supernatural and the horrific memories of his one year without a soul were trapped behind a wall in his mind, we've been left to wonder if the wall would ever come tumbling down. Well, brace yourself. At PaleyFest's salute to Supernatural Sunday evening at Saban Theater in Los Angeles, executive producer Eric Kripke revealed that in the season finale, Sam's wall is going to crumble. "We're going to deal head-on with the story of what happens when those memories come flooding loose. That's in the finale, which I just wrote and turned into Sera [Gamble] yesterday," he revealed. When the wall was constructed by Death, the brothers were warned that the mental and physical consequences of its destruction could be dire -- and we shivered in fear at the thought of Sam in that awful condition. According to star Jared Padalecki, we should be scared. "We're saving the best for last -- and the scariest for last. It does come down, and as Death warned, it's a catastrophe," he told EW. "Sam has to battle something he's never battled before, which is himself." "Sam is going to have to ultimately confront what he did soul-less and did in hell. There's a lot of Sam soul searching," he added. In related finale scoop: Kripke said fans can look for everything to "come to a head," including the war in heaven, the showdown with the Mother of All, and the mystery behind Purgatory. "It's just sort of turning everything up into a high boil," he said. And in case you were wondering, showrunner Gamble confirmed that fans will be stumping hard for a seventh season after watching the finale -- because it's a monster of a cliffhanger. The sixth season has been terrible and the thought of a seventh is not all that welcome. Sera Gamble has been a big failure as showrunner. The season has been all over the place and Castiel is officially listed as MIA. Should of finished at the end of season 5. I agree it has been a weaker season but to say it's been terrible? Disagree. The problem is both major story arcs (Mother and Sam's soul) are not "big" enough to have major show-mythology elements develop on a consistent, week-to-week basis. The last few seasons have had that stuff jam-packed into almost every episode and it is unrealistic to be able to keep up that pace I think. They really need to bring the Mother character on screen more if they want us to invest our interest in what she has going on. Also, as much as I like Cas, the show is about the brothers. I'd much rather Cas show up sporadically than as...oh, say a Dean Stockwell-esque character from Quantum Leap that serves as a informant/guide. This is what happened with Charmed (and I know the two shows should never be compared), but instead of Leo being a once in a while character he became a go find out what we have to do informer it was one of the things that destroyed the creativity of the show. Supernatural was amazing its first and second season, even season three had strong points but after word it has gone down hill and has been overrun by angels and daemons. cheese Mon 03/21/11 8:54 AM I couldn't agree with you more on the Supernatural points Brandon. Seasons 1 and 2 were far and away the best the show had to offer. The move away from saving people and hunting things and the move towards tormented soul searching and a troubled relationship between the brothers with the borefest of the angel plot lines are like cancer for this show. It was bad enough Dean went to hell and was all tortured over it (and considering what he did to other souls down there and he liked it, he seems pretty damn normal now compared so the PTSD or whatever you'd expect him to have). I can't believe they gave Sam another reason to be evil (first demon blood now he lost his soul) and to rehash the snorefest conversations they both had since season 3 and got seriously old before season 4 even started. I am had hope for the show reviving a bit once Lucifer died but the tearing down the walls thing sounds like the worst possible direction this show could possibly go at this point. End the misery please. Just because people will watch it doesn't mean you should make it. Sometimes there's value in bowing out gracefully before you've fully degenerated into a really expensive soap opera. Carrie Mon 03/14/11 2:17 AM I totally disagree. This season has been different, but by no means terrible. Even at its worst, SN is always better than 90% of the other shows on TV. I think people are quick to jump on the bandwagon of SN not being up to par this season because they know Eric Kripke isn't the showrunner anymore. It didn't bother me that Dean started the season w/ Lisa and Ben or that Sam was soulless for a while. They have to change things up or the show truly will get boring. The brothers can't be the best of friends, riding around in the Impala w/ no care in the world in every episode. They have to constantly face new challenges and the stakes need to be higher w/ each new season. I agree with you.The characters have to evolve with all that they have been through they have to change. They couldn't remain the boys from the pilot. Olivya Mon 03/14/11 8:16 AM I agree, but they could have fleshed out the season with more on the war in Heaven. Show some Castiel fighting, losing, hiding, whatever, more. Clyde M Mon 03/14/11 9:46 AM For me it has nothing to do with who's in charge. It had everything to do with plot arc -- and that arc built to an inevitable confrontation that occurred at the end of Season 5. Brother pulled back in against his will winds up making the ultimate sacrifice. Brother always trapped inside gets shot at normal life. Satan and his rogue heavenly nemesis are imprisoned. God is found. Their mission, in the large sense, concludes. Their story concludes (and as Kripke himself has said, that was the very intention of Season 5, to conclude their story). Everything after that conclusion has just felt hackneyed and tacked on...primarily because it was. PMD Mon 03/14/11 10:55 AM I agree -- everyone is quick to hate because they know that there has been a change. But honestly it has not been that bad. Is it my fave season? No. However, it is still one of the best shows out there. The biggest complaint that I have is the fact that it has felt like the story has been tacked on. I know it has been -- but they could have done a better job at hiding it. But the story line is picking up and the last few episodes have been really good -- there has been a feel of the old SPN. I did feel like the S6 finale scoop is sounding a bit like a series finale. I hope to God it is not! Especially considering Dawn Ostroff is leaving and while she does not have the greatest record in keeping good TV shows on air she has been a huge supporter of SPN. AKP Mon 03/14/11 11:57 AM I agree. I didn't expect to like Season 6 at all, and I've really enjoyed it. I don't think anything will match my love for Seasons 3 & 4, but I've been satisfied with the new season and think Supernatural has a lot of life left in it. angelcop74 Mon 03/14/11 2:53 PM i agree. It's still the best "supernatural" show on cable (current). It's always funny, and creepy which is what a show like this needs to be: Horror with a Heart. And even though this season has not been great, i would absolutely die if the show ended now. I totally agree that it should've ended at the end of 5. Everything tied up, and my favorite Winchester finally getting a shot at a normal life. The problem now is the same as it was with other great shows (The X-files) where the "creature of the week" episodes are great, interesting, hilarious, scary, and the continuously running BIG picture storyline is not-that-interesting-and-i-kinda-dont-wa\\... Hope they can fix it so when it does end, it's on a high note. Sherry Thu 03/17/11 12:47 PM I agree, still one of the BEST shows out there. I really really hope there is a season 7 and beyond. Fred Thu 03/17/11 7:41 PM Am a late comer to this show; I watched all five seasons in about a month and am starting all over again! Love it. This season had I think the funniest episode in the French Mistake. I have watched that like 4 times and am still laughing like it was the first. I agree with one of the posters, this season is still better than 90% (I think 95%!) of other shows on television. Don't hate on it....if you don't like it, don't watch. Enjoy it while we can! Jenny Tue 03/29/11 4:17 AM I have loved season 6. It's been brilliant. Not an episode I haven't sat on the edge of my seat. I've laughed, cried, cringed and just LOVED it. Sam's acting has been just the best. I for one can't wait for season seven...bring it on. This season is one of my highlights. Love it, best show EVER. alex Tue 06/21/11 12:44 PM I wouldnt go as far to say this season is at the shows worst. I will always bf a fan of supernatural, but I agree with whoever said its being over run by angels and demons, I want them to get back to more of the saving people etc. Also I think if they brought jess back, thats be pretty good Clyde M Mon 03/14/11 9:33 AM Agree. The brothers' entire plot arc climaxed and wrapped up nicely with Season 5. Season 6 was done for money and it shows. After watching all the other seasons religiously, I watched 3 episodes of this one, found it rambling and pointless, and gave up. This is like tacking a 6th Act onto Hamlet or Romeo and Juliet and I just tend to pretend it never happened. Season 6 was sort of getting to know a new show on T.V. because it was a NEW start of the same show. I always give a new show several episodes to get itself sorted out and learn more about where the show is going. If you watched at least the Vampire episode you would know that Sam is not himself.Quit whining about the differences between seasons!!! Jen E. Mon 03/14/11 9:58 AM I can't agree with terrible. I haven't been as in love with it as I have in the past...that is, until I saw The French Mistake. That was the best 60 minutes of television I've seen in a long, long time. Agree about The French Mistake. But unfortunately it was just a reminder that the show used to be that great on a regular basis. Steph Mon 03/14/11 3:32 PM I didn't enjoy that episode peronally. It felt like a rehash of the Supernatural book series from season 4. Too meta for my taste. My favorite this season was with the vampires; it was scary and creepy and more old school SN. I also liked Weekend at Bobby's. Lena Wed 05/16/12 5:47 PM I have loved every season of this show... season 6 wasnt my best I still think season's 4 & 5 were the best so far. But Supernatural is by far the show of it's type on tv......... and what better eye candy has been on screen since Prison Break?.......The Winchesters!!!!!!! Including John!!!! Lena Wed 05/16/12 5:50 PM I agree the French Mistake was awesome!!!!!! Carlos Mon 03/14/11 11:27 AM Season 6 hasn't been that great with Castiel in less scenes, but I look forward to a 7th season. I like Sam and I wish he didn't have to suffer or have such bad luck in life. I look forward to seeing more Angels representing good and not hate. We have enough Demons to deal with on earth and in hell. Angels are supposed to be good and represent good. I would like to see Angels helping Sam and Dean fight Demons like on the old CBS 'Touch By An Angel'. Disagree. I'd rather have season 6 of Supernatural than Season 1 of V, Season 1 of The Event, Season 1 of The Cape... In other words, six seasons in and now that Lost is gone, along with Fringe and maybe the BBC version of Being Human, it's still the best Sci Fi/Fantasy/Episodic programming on television. I'm happy to have Season 6. Without it we'd miss gems like Weekend At Bobby's, Live Free or Twi Hard, The French Mistake. Bring it on. I'll be tuning in. the season has been all over the place, plot wise. thus i feel the series needs a season 7 to end on a high note. it would be a disservice to the characters and the fans if season 6 was the final chapter. IMO First, sorry to be a ggrammar hag, but it's, "should HAVE" not "should of". Second, it been even close to "terrible", and while I agree it started slow, the last part of the season has gelled story-wise. It seemed that the writers didn't really know what to do with Castiel, but it looks like they finally have a story arc for him. And they've gotten their obligatory one-really-crappy episode-per-season out the way, so that's good! David, are we watching the same show? We can't be. As for Brandon's Charmed comment, you can't be serious. This show has DEFINITELY not de-volved into that show's seasons 7 and 8 awfulness. This season still managed to make sense and didn't pull two randoms out of thin air to end the show. could not disagree more. most fans are in this for the long haul, and we can deal with a few weaker episodes while the new crew gets it together. plus, the fairies episode was awesome and the meta ep hilarious! I love this season, and I didn't think I would enjoy it. I could always use more Castiel and the civil war in heaven deserves more screen time than it's gotten so far, but overall I am excited to see how the diverging plots eventually converge. Plus I'm not ready to say goodbye to the four amigos yet. Absolutely can't wait to see it! Although I agree the season has been a tad uneven, I think it has come up with some terrific arches to takeover the empty space the apocalypse left behind. I thought soulless Sam was great (and Jared obviously had a field day playing him), I am excited to see where the Mother and War in Heaven stories both go, and I am looking forward to the wall coming down. I hope there is definitely a season 7 and maybe an 8. I am just so hooked on Supernatural, I can't fathom living without new episodes yet. This has been the worse season so far. The only episode that I enjoyed was "Weekend at Bobby's." Season four was by far the best, and season five was too unevendue to the fact that no-one knew whether or not the show was going to end with season five or not. The show should have either ended with seasone five, or become a Samuel Colt spin-off, with the same actors. I have conned many of my friends into watching the show and buying the dvds. And now that the show is in reruns, I have been watching the still-amazing Fringe -- and I encourage my fello viewers td the sa. Considering the ratings the CW has, no matter what people say Supernatural is a winner and this season has been great, so why even doubt there would be a 7th season, seriously those executives would be very stupid not to renew the show ASAP! Can't wait to see what's next. This season hasn't been my favorite but I do want to see a season 7. The plot lines have great potential been none of them has really been touched on enough to make them as epic as seasons 1-5. Hopefully season 7 will embelish some of those storylines and give them the life they deserve. I have never been much of a CW fan but LOVE this show and want to see it continued. Everyone expects the show to remain exactly as it was for the last 5 years and that is ridiculous! It's evolving and changing just like everything should. You people who call yourselves fans are never satisfied! You complained about the show moving away from the monster of the week set up when they set up the AWESOME Apocalypse arc. You complained about Kripke's amazing season 5 finale. And now that Sera Gamble and the talented writers are trying to bring it back to the monster of the week formant for all you whiny people-but doing it with a dynamic, interesting twist and setting up new mythologies and mysterious bad guys-YOU STILL COMPLAIN! I agree that a few episodes this season weren't up to par with almost every other episode of Supernatural-but it was 1 or 2-and they still had stuff in them that I like. The funny thing is, those 1 or 2 mediocre episodes followed a more "monster of the week" style format to please all you HATERS out there. Watch the show, enjoy what is there, and SHUT UP! So over the negativity! Or don't watch and let the real fans stay tuned in. I cannot wait to see what happens with the War and the souls and Purgatory and- oh yeah, Sam fighting himself again. Everyone likes to blame SG for this, but this has been Kripke's thing since the first season- Sam fighting his father, his anger, his destiny, his brother, outer demons, inner demons. I like it, I always have. I like this season, and if they don't renew the show, I will be bitterly disappointed. Esp. if they renew One Tree Hill (aren't they collecting Social Security by now?) I am greatly enjoying season 6 and I hope for a season 7. One reason why I wonder if they are not renewing shows yet is if they are waiting to see who looks to be taking Dawn Osteroff's (sp?) place as the head of the CW. Regardless of why, I disagree with the people who have said the show is completely different because you can still find many similarities to how the show was done in previous seasons and if you were expecting the characters to go through 5 seasons without changing then I encourage you to just rewatch the same season over and over again because what you ask for is unrealistic and boring. I think Sera has been doing a fine job and has surprised me with some plot twists she has made. Just because Kripke isn't calling every shot doesn't mean that there's still a loving family of people making the show as awesome as it was and is. Jared, Jensen, Jim, the writers, directors, crew and more all help the show progress and it is their piece of art they create together. If you think they should do things differently then by all means make your own show, but I think I'll spend my time watching these fantastic people at their craft.
NA	Mitt Romney Rejects His Natural Voters The political fallout from Mitt Romney's characterization of 47% of the American electorate as "victims" who are "dependent on government" and refuse to take "personal responsibility" for their lives demonstrates anew that cultural generalizations, particularly in politics, are usually dangerous. In fact, Romney appears to have categorized a large segment of his party's own voters as supporters of President Barack Obama. As a rule, one should judge people on their merits, not on the supposed attributes of the racial, socioeconomic, or geographic groups to which they belong. Yet statistical relationships sometimes are so strong that it is worth pondering their significance. In the United States, a distinction is frequently drawn between citizens of "red states," which usually vote for the Republican Party, and those of "blue states" -- concentrated in the Northeast, the upper Midwest, and the Pacific coast -- which usually vote for the Democratic Party. The unspoken truth is that, compared to "blue-staters," those who live in red states exhibit less responsibility, on average, in their personal behavior: they are less physically fit, less careful in their sexual behavior, more prone to inflict harm on themselves and others through smoking and drinking, and more likely to receive federal subsidies. Statistical analysis shows that states where more residents suffer from obesity , often because they get less physical exercise and eat more junk food , tend to vote Republican. To illustrate, a mere 1% decrease in a state's obesity on average is estimated to raise the ratio of Democratic to Republican voters from 1.00 to 1.07, easily enough to swing an election. Similarly, states with high pregnancy rates among girls aged 15-17 tend to vote Republican. Again, the relationship is highly significant statistically. Evidently, people in New England, New York, and Hawaii, who more often vote Democratic, are not just slimmer, but are also less prone to engage in unprotected sex than those in the South and Republican-leaning Midwestern states. States with high rates of cigarette smoking also vote Republican, as do states with high rates of fatal accidents from drunk driving . The average score of the five "reddest" states (Wyoming, Oklahoma, Utah, Idaho, and Alaska) is worse on each of six measures of irresponsibility than the average score of the five "bluest" (New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Hawaii): more obesity, smoking, chlamydia, teenage pregnancy, drunk-driving fatalities, and firearms assaults. In the latter three measures, the "reckless" share of the population is almost twice as high among the reddest states as it is among the bluest. The states that score worst on these measures are also the states whose congressional representatives voted against Obama's Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in 2010, though many of these unhealthy people free-ride on their fellow citizens when they show up uninsured in hospital emergency rooms. That political hypocrisy comes at a price : obese Americans incur medical costs that are 42% higher than those of normal-weight Americans. Figure 1 combines all of these variables into a single measure of personal behavior, state by state, with citizens of states on the left-hand side behaving more irresponsibly. The vertical dimension shows the ratio of Democratic to Republican votes in the 2008 presidential election. The overall relationship, again, is statistically significant: those with the least responsible behavior are the most likely to vote Republican. Policy wonks have long known that one gets similar results when looking at which states receive more federal subsidies : Despite all the rhetoric about "getting the government off our backs," the red states receive the most federal transfers, with Alaska, Mississippi, Louisiana, West Virginia, and the Dakotas topping the list. Democratic-leaning states -- especially New York, New Jersey, California, and the New England states -- are net contributors to the federal budget, and thus subsidize everyone else. Those who claim to be most fiscally conservative in fact tend to feed most voraciously at the public trough. Blue-state residents, who tend to be more educated and have higher incomes than residents of red states, have refrained from suggesting that their red-states compatriots exhibit behavior that falls short of the conservative rhetoric of personal responsibility. It would be unseemly and perhaps "elitist" to point fingers at fellow Americans and imply that they are promiscuous , fat , gluttonous , lazy , uneducated , or that they are more prone to divorce , drunkeness , and gun-related deaths . Fortunately, the conservative political scientist Charles Murray points out some of these statistics in his latest book, Coming Apart . Murray argues that those living in the "super-zip codes" -- areas with high levels of income and education, such as Belmont, Massachusetts -- have maintained the traditional American values of hard work and family values. Those who live elsewhere have shown "crashing" rates of industriousness and marriage. Indeed, according to Murray, they leave the labor force, often falsely claiming disability. They "goof off," "sleeping and watching television." Those with jobs have reduced their working hours, while those living in the super-zip codes have increased theirs. The proportion of children born out of wedlock has skyrocketed for women who did not finish high school, to more than 60%, which is more than 12 times the rate among women who finish college. (Murray's statistics are based on whites alone, to control for race.) For Murray, however, the blame lies with those living in the super-zip codes: "The new upper class still does a good job of practicing some of the virtues, but it no longer preaches them. It preaches nonjudgmentalism instead." So the problem is "an unwillingness on the part of any significant portion of the new upper class to preach what they practice." That is a stunning argument, especially coming from a conservative/libertarian. What about the millions of red-state Americans who have been preaching hard work, family values, self-reliance, and small government, while practicing the opposite? Surely this is the more objectionable stance. Yet, for red-state politicians, this hypocrisy has been a winning electoral strategy for three decades.

Comments The ridiculous thing about Romney's comments is not that it shows he is incredibly out of touch with the majority of Americans, nor that although he only pays 15 percent of his income in taxes on his multi-million dollar income he thinks those that make less than $30,000 a year should pay more, it's that there are still tens of millions of Americans that will vote for him. The problem with most Americans is they still think the merican Dream" is achievable, so they will vote for elitists like Romney with the idea that, once they get rich, they too will reap the benefits. Sadly, most of them will never make more than minimum wage and will be abused at every turn by those of Romney's ilk.

OP	Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile -- review ITV documentary on Jimmy Savile was one of the most talked about shows of recent times. Photograph: Dezo Hoffmann/Rex Features As a TV performer, Sir Jimmy Savile flourished in peak-time, or at least the early part of it: his key vehicles -- Jim'll Fix It, Top of the Pops -- had necessarily to be scheduled before the bedtimes of what we now hesitate to call the target audience of teenagers. Savile would have considered a 23:10 ITV peak-time slot career death. But it seems almost certain to be the case that his status as a cherished television personality died there -- posthumously -- on Wednesday night, with the irony that one of the most talked-about shows of recent times had to be screened in this low-ratings zone because its stories about a children's TV presenter were so unsuitable for children. As is now commonly the case with high-profile factual films and books, the contents of Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile had been gutted and discussed for days in advance. The allegations of sexual assaults or rape of underage girls at BBC studios, in the entertainer's trademark cars and motor home and at a school in Surrey, had all been widely previewed in newspapers. But, though robbed of the effect of revelation, the film still exercised a hold because of the sense of poetic justice in television being the instrument of exposure. As in an opera about Mozart or a poem concerning Sylvia Plath, Savile was being judged through the medium that made him, with the final blow being delivered by someone who was a fellow star of 1970s and 80s' BBC weekend schedules, Esther Rantzen. Sue Thompson, a former producer at the BBC, says she saw Jimmy Saville abusing a teenage girl in his dressing room Link to this video Savile was, she concluded after watching the testimony collected by reporter Mark Williams-Thomas -- a former detective who investigates historic child abuse cases -- "a child-abuser ... the jury is no longer out". The film's advantage over the week-long filleting of its findings in print was the sharp use of archive footage. A clip from a BBC show called Clunk-Click, in which Savile and guest star Gary Glitter snuggle up to teenage female studio guests now seems chillingly giveaway, with Savile leering: "He's got two. I shouldn't be giving girls away!" In the documentary's killer line, one woman who says she was abused by Savile even suggests that his signature costume on and off-screen had a gruesome hidden significance: "I'm sure the reason he always wore shellsuits was so that he could get the shellsuit bottoms down very quickly." The programme's weakness was that a traditional strength of film documentary -- that eyeline, tone and body-language help assessment of a witness's testimony -- had to be surrendered because of the understandable reticence of the alleged victims: some were given disguised voices and false names on screen, another was played by an actor. In the media ether, defenders of Savile or moral justice or both have been expressing concern that it is wrong to try a dead man for paedophilia when he has no possibility of defending himself. But the counter-argument is that so powerful was the fame and charitable carapace of Savile that his accusers could never have brought him to court during his lifetime. And, if we are to believe that the widespread stories from separate sources are a conspiracy against Savile's memory, then it would be a bizarre cabal and to no obvious end. For BBC executives, the programme will have made mixed viewing. Impressively, it was shown that two BBC programmes, featuring Louis Theroux and Coleen Nolan, raised the allegations during Savile's lifetime. More alarmingly, Williams-Thomas' dossier suggested repeated assaults taking place on BBC premises -- enabled by the fact that Savile specialised in broadcast formats involving the young. The documentary had been re-edited at the last minute to insert a firmer statement of regret and intention to investigate than the Corporation had initially given. As broadcasters including Rantzen and Paul Gambaccini have said, this film merely confirms long and relentless hospitality room gossip. Williams-Thomas concluded the report by saying that publicity for the film had caused other women to come forward. But, by midnight, the reputation of a peak-time legend had already been convincingly devastated in -- appropriately -- what broadcasters call the graveyard slot.

Everybody in football and most of the fans knew about Torres' knee problem when he arrived at Liverpool.

I heard rumours about the mishandling of Torres under Rafa Several members of the medical staff did 'leave their posts' when Rafa did - make of that what you will! That was because Purslow brought in the new Australian Medical/Fitness staff, which made some of the current staff at the time, redundant. I do think we did mess around with Torres a little bit by making come back too early at times. There was at one point in the 09/10 season where both Gerrard/Torres came back from international duty injured (around October). Gerrard had a groin problem so couldn't play at all for several weeks, which led us to playing Torres through a pain barrier, carrying an injury (I think he had a week break though before playing again). He should've had an operation on his achilles problems (or somewhere like that), but played. This operation would've allegedly would've take 6 weeks to recover from. Gerrard made his return, and then Torres was taken out of the firing line (couldn't play), and the club announced that they would be "managing" the situation for 3 weeks, instead of going for the option of having an operation (going for what they believed to be the shorter route). Instead of 3 weeks, he ended up being out for five weeks. In other words, he should've had the operation to be fully fit, but didn't. In Jan, he needed a knee operation, and had another in April. He had shocking season full of injuries. Gerrard was similarly mismanaged slightly IMO, constantly coming back too early and having to play through injury..... in that 09/10 season too. Stevie eventually had that massive groin operation in March 2011, which has fortunately gotten rid of most of his muscle injuries that he used to suffer. Both have been fairly injury free for a while now, but clearly those problems have taken a toll on both of them. Originally Posted by KOPGIRL1971 Spain did for most of torres' injuries, and we paid the price. Rafa also allowed him to go off and have his op, so he could be ready for the World Cup, which didn't work out. What a load of poppycokk Good point. Most of his injuries always stemmed from coming back from Spain International duty. Whatever we tried to do, the momentum was always broken when he went away, and he always came back injured.

I heard rumours about the mishandling of Torres under Rafa Several members of the medical staff did 'leave their posts' when Rafa did - make of that what you will! I'm certain I've seen posts/threads about LFC medical staff rushing back and falsely telling Benitez that Torres was fit to play, and that's why some parted company with the club. Certainly hope we're better nowadays because the mismanagement of Torres rehabilitation led to the deterioration of his relationship with the club. 2 reasons wh Torres has gone from most dangerous striker in world football to player lost are: 1 He has lost a couple of years of pace and importantly does not have that blistering pace from a standing start. 2 Stevie G was the best midfield player in the country and laid on pass after amazing pass to him. He has lost his pace because of several injuries over a few years (there worst being the much talked about knee injury) Now whether he was lied to about the nature of the injury (which I can believe) its not our fault that Chelsea did not carry out a medical on a 50mil pound player. I thought Purslow had a hand in it. Rumours going around at the time was that Purslow had the medical staff doctor their reports on Torres so rafa would play him as there was a better chance of selling the club with us in the top four and that was a gamble Purslow was willing to take.

Stress Management How to Reduce, prevent, and Cope with Stress It may seem that there's nothing you can do about stress. The bills won't stop coming, there will never be more hours in the day, and your career and family responsibilities will always be demanding. But you have more control than you might think. In fact, the simple realization that you're in control of your life is the foundation of stress management. Managing stress is all about taking charge: of your thoughts, emotions, schedule, and the way you deal with problems Identify the sources of stress in your life Learn about hidden sources of stress Stress management starts with identifying the sources of stress in your life. This isn't as easy as it sounds. Your true sources of stress aren't always obvious, and it's all too easy to overlook your own stress-inducing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Sure, you may know that you're constantly worried about work deadlines. But maybe it's your procrastination, rather than the actual job demands, that leads to deadline stress. Do you explain away stress as temporary ("I just have a million things going on right now") even though you can't remember the last time you took a breather? Do you define stress as an integral part of your work or home life ("Things are always crazy around here") or as a part of your personality ("I have a lot of nervous energy, that's all"). Do you blame your stress on other people or outside events, or view it as entirely normal and unexceptional? Until you accept responsibility for the role you play in creating or maintaining it, your stress level will remain outside your control. Start a stress journal A stress journal can help you identify the regular stressors in your life and the way you deal with them. Each time you feel stressed, keep track of it in your journal. As you keep a daily log, you will begin to see patterns and common themes. Write down: What caused your stress (make a guess if you're unsure). How you felt, both physically and emotionally. How you acted in response. What you did to make yourself feel better. Look at how you currently cope with stress Think about the ways you currently manage and cope with stress in your life. Your stress journal can help you identify them. Are your coping strategies healthy or unhealthy, helpful or unproductive? Unfortunately, many people cope with stress in ways that compound the problem. Unhealthy ways of coping with stress These coping strategies may temporarily reduce stress, but they cause more damage in the long run: Learning healthier ways to manage stress If your methods of coping with stress aren't contributing to your greater emotional and physical health, it's time to find healthier ones. There are many healthy ways to manage and cope with stress, but they all require change. You can either change the situation or change your reaction. When deciding which option to choose, it's helpful to think of the four As: avoid, alter, adapt, or accept. Since everyone has a unique response to stress, there is no "one size fits all" solution to managing it. No single method works for everyone or in every situation, so experiment with different techniques and strategies. Focus on what makes you feel calm and in control. Dealing with Stressful Situations: The Four A's Change the situation: Avoid the stressor. Alter the stressor. Change your reaction: Adapt to the stressor. Accept the stressor. Stress management strategy #1: Avoid unnecessary stress Not all stress can be avoided, and it's not healthy to avoid a situation that needs to be addressed. You may be surprised, however, by the number of stressors in your life that you can eliminate. Learn how to say "no" -- Know your limits and stick to them. Whether in your personal or professional life, refuse to accept added responsibilities when you're close to reaching them. Taking on more than you can handle is a surefire recipe for stress. Avoid people who stress you out -- If someone consistently causes stress in your life and you can't turn the relationship around, limit the amount of time you spend with that person or end the relationship entirely. Take control of your environment -- If the evening news makes you anxious, turn the TV off. If traffic's got you tense, take a longer but less-traveled route. If going to the market is an unpleasant chore, do your grocery shopping online. Avoid hot-button topics -- If you get upset over religion or politics, cross them off your conversation list. If you repeatedly argue about the same subject with the same people, stop bringing it up or excuse yourself when it's the topic of discussion. Pare down your to-do list -- Analyze your schedule, responsibilities, and daily tasks. If you've got too much on your plate, distinguish between the "shoulds" and the "musts." Drop tasks that aren't truly necessary to the bottom of the list or eliminate them entirely. Stress management strategy #2: Alter the situation If you can't avoid a stressful situation, try to alter it. Figure out what you can do to change things so the problem doesn't present itself in the future. Often, this involves changing the way you communicate and operate in your daily life. Express your feelings instead of bottling them up. If something or someone is bothering you, communicate your concerns in an open and respectful way. If you don't voice your feelings, resentment will build and the situation will likely remain the same. Be willing to compromise. When you ask someone to change their behavior, be willing to do the same. If you both are willing to bend at least a little, you'll have a good chance of finding a happy middle ground. Be more assertive. Don't take a backseat in your own life. Deal with problems head on, doing your best to anticipate and prevent them. If you've got an exam to study for and your chatty roommate just got home, say up front that you only have five minutes to talk. Manage your time better. Poor time management can cause a lot of stress. When you're stretched too thin and running behind, it's hard to stay calm and focused. But if you plan ahead and make sure you don't overextend yourself, you can alter the amount of stress you're under. Stress management strategy #3: Adapt to the stressor If you can't change the stressor, change yourself. You can adapt to stressful situations and regain your sense of control by changing your expectations and attitude. Reframe problems. Try to view stressful situations from a more positive perspective. Rather than fuming about a traffic jam, look at it as an opportunity to pause and regroup, listen to your favorite radio station, or enjoy some alone time. Look at the big picture. Take perspective of the stressful situation. Ask yourself how important it will be in the long run. Will it matter in a month? A year? Is it really worth getting upset over? If the answer is no, focus your time and energy elsewhere. Adjust your standards. Perfectionism is a major source of avoidable stress. Stop setting yourself up for failure by demanding perfection. Set reasonable standards for yourself and others, and learn to be okay with "good enough." Focus on the positive. When stress is getting you down, take a moment to reflect on all the things you appreciate in your life, including your own positive qualities and gifts. This simple strategy can help you keep things in perspective. Adjusting Your Attitude How you think can have a profound effect on your emotional and physical well-being. Each time you think a negative thought about yourself, your body reacts as if it were in the throes of a tension-filled situation. If you see good things about yourself, you are more likely to feel good; the reverse is also true. Eliminate words such as "always," "never," "should," and "must." These are telltale marks of self-defeating thoughts. Stress management strategy #4: Accept the things you can't change Some sources of stress are unavoidable. You can't prevent or change stressors such as the death of a loved one, a serious illness, or a national recession. In such cases, the best way to cope with stress is to accept things as they are. Acceptance may be difficult, but in the long run, it's easier than railing against a situation you can't change. Don't try to control the uncontrollable. Many things in life are beyond our control -- particularly the behavior of other people. Rather than stressing out over them, focus on the things you can control such as the way you choose to react to problems. Look for the upside. As the saying goes, "What doesn't kill us makes us stronger." When facing major challenges, try to look at them as opportunities for personal growth. If your own poor choices contributed to a stressful situation, reflect on them and learn from your mistakes. Share your feelings. Talk to a trusted friend or make an appointment with a therapist. Expressing what you're going through can be very cathartic, even if there's nothing you can do to alter the stressful situation. Learn to forgive. Accept the fact that we live in an imperfect world and that people make mistakes. Let go of anger and resentments. Free yourself from negative energy by forgiving and moving on. Stress management strategy #5: Make time for fun and relaxation Beyond a take-charge approach and a positive attitude, you can reduce stress in your life by nurturing yourself. If you regularly make time for fun and relaxation, you'll be in a better place to handle life's stressors when they inevitably come. Healthy ways to relax and recharge Go for a walk. Spend time in nature. Call a good friend. Sweat out tension with a good workout. Write in your journal. Take a long bath. Light scented candles. Savor a warm cup of coffee or tea. Play with a pet. Work in your garden. Get a massage. Curl up with a good book. Listen to music. Watch a comedy. Don't get so caught up in the hustle and bustle of life that you forget to take care of your own needs. Nurturing yourself is a necessity, not a luxury. Set aside relaxation time. Include rest and relaxation in your daily schedule. Don't allow other obligations to encroach. This is your time to take a break from all responsibilities and recharge your batteries. Connect with others. Spend time with positive people who enhance your life. A strong support system will buffer you from the negative effects of stress. Do something you enjoy every day. Make time for leisure activities that bring you joy, whether it be stargazing, playing the piano, or working on your bike. Keep your sense of humor. This includes the ability to laugh at yourself. The act of laughing helps your body fight stress in a number of ways. Stress management strategy #6: Adopt a healthy lifestyle Exercise regularly . Physical activity plays a key role in reducing and preventing the effects of stress. Make time for at least 30 minutes of exercise, three times per week. Nothing beats aerobic exercise for releasing pent-up stress and tension. Eat a healthy diet . Well-nourished bodies are better prepared to cope with stress, so be mindful of what you eat. Start your day right with breakfast, and keep your energy up and your mind clear with balanced, nutritious meals throughout the day. Reduce caffeine and sugar. The temporary "highs" caffeine and sugar provide often end in with a crash in mood and energy. By reducing the amount of coffee, soft drinks, chocolate, and sugar snacks in your diet, you'll feel more relaxed and you'll sleep better. Avoid alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs. Self-medicating with alcohol or drugs may provide an easy escape from stress, but the relief is only temporary. Don't avoid or mask the issue at hand; deal with problems head on and with a clear mind. Get enough sleep . Adequate sleep fuels your mind, as well as your body. Feeling tired will increase your stress because it may cause you to think irrationally.

ID	I don't know what to do. When I am in a long-term, committed relationship I feel like my boyfriend looks at me like a chain around his neck. So, I think he will probably cheat or leave me soon. It makes me someone I am not, or brings out the worst in me: jealousy, insecurity and fear. I have tried thinking about relationships differently, but it doesn't work. I want to be with one man and if he cheats or leaves, what do I do? I guess I start over, right? I am rambling, sorry... I guess what I am looking for is a way to look at life and love that allows me some peace of mind. I want to know that things will be OK if I am cheated on or left. I want to be happy. Thanks for reading and if you want to share something with me, anything, it would be great. Thanks. Wildrose, you ask a very wise question. It is wise, because you didn't ask "How do I find a boyfriend who will never cheat?" You also have realized that "trying to think differently" doesn't work. Isn't that a great thing to notice? So many people walk around trying to control the thoughts in their heads...and a lot of them never get around to admitting how futile that is. So you are actually ahead of the game here. You know you can't control the actions of your boyfriend. You know you can't control the thoughts in your own head. So now what can you do with the anxiety you feel, every time you think of being cheated on or left? How do you get to that place where it will be "okay" for you - if it ever does happen? I would suggest to you that you give up the belief that it will ever be "okay" to be treated badly. It will always hurt, and it will not be a good day in your life if it happens. You will likely be a train wreck of epic proportions, and spend a week or so on the bathroom floor in tears, before scraping yourself up and trudging on with your life. Your friends will have to circle the wagons to help carry you through this time. Your family will likely need to stay close and watchful. If you don't have a strong support group, you will find a caring and compassionate therapist to help carry you. Your heart will be broken, you'll probably lose weight whether unwanted or not, and your trust in men will take a dive that leaves them all looking like slime trails left in the dirt by slugs who took off and dumped their little slug girlfriends. But then one day, you'll find that the hurt is a little less. You'll notice color slowly returning to your world. A man will say a kind word to you, and you'll keep the sharp pointy sticks in your pockets, instead of pulling them out and gouging his eyes. That is the day your heart begins to heal, and before you know it a healing heart is a joyous thing. So there, at the end of a long windy and wordy answer that looked like it was going nowhere, even to me, is the answer: Your peace lies on the OTHER side of the experience. You can never make peace with being cheated on, nor should you want to try, from THIS side of the experience. There is not  a pre-emptive broken heart that you can hurry up and get on with, and once it's done it's done and all is roses. As long as you are willing to love, you risk hurt. But from hurt emerges many wonderful - miraculous almost, - human qualities: perseverance, strength, forgiveness, overcoming adversity,learning to love again. You may go down like a ton of bricks if this ever happens to you - in fact no doubt you will - but you will emerge from those ashes like a phoenix rising. Take peace in knowing that, and now get on with what you can do today...keep loving. insecurity can cause all kinds of problems including jealousy and fear. you have to learn to control these feelings because they can cause the other person to leave. there is no excuse for cheating none what so ever so if that is the kind of boyfriends you are with you need to look elsewhere. when you meet your soulmate you won't want to cheat because you love and cherish them above all others and so will he. but in order for any type of relationship to work out you need to find out why you are so insecure and conquer this. i hope you meet the love of your life and you have the love and happiness i had with my husbad for 37 years. keep looking he is out there somewhere and when you find him you will know that it all was worth it. Know thyself The first step is to let yourself feel what you feel.  You're never going to be able to say, "I shouldn't feel this way."  Maybe you shouldn't, but it never works to just tell yourself not to. In fact, take a step back and say to yourself, "I am worth having a long-term, committed relationship with."  This isn't just incantation build-it-and-they-will-come mumbo jumbo.  You need know why it's true.  Say it to yourself, and if it doesn't sound right, find out why.  If there's something you don't like about yourself, you're going to go about either acknowledging it and making sure you understand that it's part of you, or changing it.  It's OK if you can't change it, but you need to recognize it about yourself and accept that it's really part of you. Once you understand what's worthy about you, you can start to figure out why it is you're worried.  Again, we're going to try to sidestep pop-psychology mumbo-jumbo, and get to the root of of the matter.  How many long-term relationships have you had?  Have the men actually cheated on you, or left you? What about them caused them to do that, despite the fact that you're worth sticking around for?  (That's why we did the previous step, because you can't do it until you understand what it is you have to offer.)  Are you choosing bad men, or are they finding out that you're not right for them? If you're making bad choices, you're going to have to break your habits.  Without knowing what your habits are I can't tell you how to go about doing that, but start with being alone for a while.  I've found that in most cases like yours, women are so afraid of being alone that they'll choose any man rather than picking one with the qualities they seek.  They're not really seeking a man; they're seeking "a relationship".  But they're only seeing what the relationship does for them, and not really seeing the other half of the relationship as a person. If you're afraid he's going to cheat, figure out why he'd want to do that.  No, you can't just walk up to him and ask that, because he's going to tell you what you want to hear.  This is an exercise in how well you understand him, a crucial element of a real long-term relationship.  You already know in general what a man's motivations are to cheat.  The question is, what is attracting him, and how can you mitigate it? (Many women want to skip this because they're afraid of losing time, of their beauty, of their biological clocks.  Forget about being beautiful: it's only important in the first few minutes of a relationship, to get noticed.  There are other ways to be noticed.  As for your biological clock, do not rush into it.  You're talking about creating a human being, and that's not a thing to be done just because you can't do it later.) Everything I'm asking you to do is hard.  I'm asking you to take risks of not getting what you want, rather than grasp at straws.  I'm putting it all on you because it's about getting what you want, which starts with knowing what you want and why you want it. Because now we get to the really hard part, and coming back to the start: dealing with the fact that you have feelings that you know consciously aren't rational.  If you're clingy, and that's unpleasant for him, you know you're not really reassuring yourself and in fact driving him away. I told you those feelings are real and won't go away, but now you're finally in a position to get him to help.  Tell him what your fears are, and admit them AS fears. They're part of you, and don't go away just because you tell them to. You're asking him to work around them, and if he's worth having a long-term commitment with, he will.  You compromise in a relationship to work around the things you can't handle by yourself, and this is one. I need to stress that that's the continuation of the process, not the beginning.  If you start out by telling him he needs to work around your feelings before you understand them yourself, he's going to feel like he's working harder than you are on it.  You need to present it as a thing to work on together, not a problem of yours that's now his problem instead. Once you see that he's willing to help, your fears will gradually subside.  They're never going to go away, but once you see that you're not working on them alone you'll be in a better position.  You'll know not just that he's staying, but that he WANTS to stay, and why. And if he doesn't want to stay, then the relationship isn't real, and nothing is going to change that.  Don't cling to just having any relationship; you need to demand one for yourself that meets your needs.
SP	...about people who change their lives to settle on the Range and why they choose to stay THIS MONTH ... Tina & Allan Rhode Tina and Allan Rhode moved to the Blackall Range only weeks ago... having bought a business in Montville's main street, and then a beautiful home on acreage in Flaxton. This pair of babyboomer professionals, have found the perfect place to lay the foundations for a long and settled future. Why did you come here? Tina: Well, we were looking for businesses in the area because we had decided we wanted to work together again. Also, we wanted to be away from Brisbane but not too far because we have grandkids in Brisbane. Allan: We both started out in Melbourne thirty years ago and since then we have lived and worked in a variety of places, but it's funny how our paths have always led back through Montville, whilst we've been on holidays, visiting or bringing relatives or friends here. Although we always brought them up to Montville, we never ever imagined that we would be living in this area. Coming here has been in the planning process for a couple of months. One of our strict criteria to find a business was something within an hour and a half of Brisbane, so that we would retain that good contact with our son, daughter-in-law and granddaughters. We were in contact with John (Taylor) at Montville Real Estate, looking for businesses, and then John mentioned that retirement was on the cards for him so we started discussing the purchase of Montville Real Estate. What did you have to change in coming here? Tina: Well, Allan has been a salesman in real estate before and I have worked in property management. So, we've been there if you like, in terms of real estate and property. Allan: Between hospitality and customer service, we've also been in management and had a lot to do with good customer service. So, we were looking for a business that would enable us to go somewhere and fulfill a long term vision. We firmly believe this business fulfills all the criteria for a strong community of interesting people, and the lifestyle that we were looking for. Despite that, I know I have to change my attitude to gardening, because coming from a residential block of land to just over two acres and a beautiful property in Flaxton with fruit trees, vegetable gardens ... there is a lot more involved in that! Of course the rewards are there like walking out into the vegetable garden and getting half your dinner from that, or just enjoying the bird life. It suited us perfectly ... we've got room for family and friends to visit, and we've got the garden to enjoy. Tina: This is not going to be a nine to five job. It's learning to balance and because we have worked together before, it's not going to be an issue. I might have some time off and then he might have some time off, and if we can build up the business, then we can have some time off together. Allan: We are already starting to learn the streets here and meet the people. For us there's a focus on not what you can get out of it, but what you can do for other people. It takes a while of course for people to get to know and understand you and trust you. Real estate is all about that, because you have to fulfill someone else's needs , wants wishes and desires. We both love helping people and becoming part of a community, so it's an excellent fit for what we need ourselves personally. What would keep you here? Allan: One way or another, at this stage of our lives, I can see us staying here for the indefinite future. We're so close to everything, we don't want for anything here. We intend to do as much business locally as we can and use local suppliers and providers where possible. Tina: This particular field of business suits us because it is something we can do until we decide to retire. Allan: What would keep us here? The feel of the area and growing into a circle of friends, acquaintances and neighbours. Personally, I understand there is a good wood-working group here so I may take that on. We'd also like to learn more about the chamber of commerce. Tina: As we become more a part of this community we could hopefully contribute and introduce new ideas. But if the bottom really fell out of the real estate market ... and I don't believe it will ...
NA	Open Access offers antidote to overpriced journals To students leaving the academic world, the cost of information may come as a shock. Without access to the extensive collections of the McGill library, journal articles cost around 30 dollars per view. The library pays thousands of dollars per journal subscription. In 2011, McGill paid $12,224,900 for journals and research database access; thisrepresents more than 30 per cent of the Library budget. Open-access journals would make these costs a thing of the past. Despite their expensive access fees, academic journals do not pay for the content they publish, and in many cases peer reviews are performed free of charge. Researchers must publish to stay relevant in their field, which is critical to job security. Tenure awards and funding sources consider volume of work published as well as the work??s impact factor, measured by the number of other papers that cite it. In an open-access world, academic papers would be free for readers. The idea behind the Open Acces Movement is that removing financial barriers to peer-reviewed material would create a more productive exchange of ideas. Changing the cost structure of academic articles also appeals on a fundamental level, because it spreads scientific information. Last month, McGill participated in a global event to raise awareness about the state of academic publishing. Open Access Week was conceived as a national day for open access in 2007 by two U.S. groups, and has grown every year since??in 2010, universities in 94 countries marked the event. ??It??s important for the community to think about what the ultimate results of their research will be. I would argue that most researchers want their work to be read by as many people as possible,?_ Amy Buckland, McGill library eScholarship, ePublishing, andA  Digitization coordinator, said. The McGill library participated in the week by holding several small workshops and promoting McGill??s own open-access repository??eScholarship@Mcgill. The Open Access Movement faces several important challenges, nincluding the tenure and promotion process, which favours older, established journals that other researchers are more likely to cite. Although some journals are now offering open-access versions of their publication, ??many publications [currently] use restrictive copyright transfer agreements which prohibit researchers from making their work publicly available via their own website, or their institution??s repository,?_ Buckland said. Another hurdle is financing open-access journals. One proposal is to charge researchers for cost of editing and publishing. Widespread changes to academic publishing may be a long time coming. ??[Open access faces] many challenges, but that doesn??t mean it??s not a worthy goal,?_ Buckland said.
IN	15 Ways to Travel for Free (or at least cheap) "To travel cheap, you need to be looking for opportunities and be willing to take them. You have to be somewhat proactive and not be afraid to ask for advice, help, guidance. Ask for what you want -- it's amazing what people are willing to give. I discovered that most people are very willing and are looking to give to the right person. You miss 100 percent of the opportunities you don't take..." Jim Lawrence, 34, travelled around the world for nearly free... for eight years . We've all heard the old adage that the best things in life are always free. But most people assume this rule only applies to life's little pleasures like smelling flowers or laughing with friends. And sure, those are nice, but what about those bigger pleasures, like jetting off across the world? Can you do that for free too? Well, if not for free, then very cheap. If you're looking for an international experience but don't have the cash to splurge on it, this article is for you. You don't need thousands of dollars to get yourself on the road. In fact, all you need is a little originality, some guts and enthusiasm, and some ideas to get you started. Some of the ideas below are sensible ones that Granny would approve of. Others are a little more risqu -- it's amazing what some people will do to save a buck -- but hey, since when do you take Granny's advice anyway? So don't let your empty wallet stop you from taking the trip of a lifetime. Just remember: with the right attitude, the best things in life -- even travelling -- can come pretty cheap. 1. House-swap or rent out your home In a nutshell: Made famous by the recent movie The Holiday , this option, of course, requires you to have a house. If you do have a house to offer up, there are various websites that provide online classifieds for owners to advertise ( homeexchange.com , homexchangevacation.com or homebase-hols.com ). Most require a registration fee, but then you can advertise your property for the entire year. The length of time for exchanges depends on the needs of the two parties swapping houses. Another alternative for those travellers lucky enough to be property owners is to rent out your home. What advocates say: Accommodation with no cash down? This is a no-brainer. Staying in a home rather than a hotel usually has perks like an equipped kitchen, telephone and some may even have internet. And renting out your home while you're away is a great source of cash; monthly rent from an apartment in Toronto, Vancouver or even St. John's can go a long way towards covering your costs in Bolivia or Ghana. What Granny would say: Screen candidates carefully before handing over your keys, otherwise you may not have a home to come back to. 2. House-sit In a nutshell: If you're kipping in your parents' spare room, sleeping in a college dorm, or surfing on your friends' sofas then you're out of luck on the house-swapping front (or, more accurately, you may already be travelling for free). But a house-sitting gig may be an option for you. If you are looking to house-sit, there are online boards where you can advertise your services. Check out: www.housecarers.com , www.mindmyhouse.com for postings in several different countries, or national boards such as Australia's housesitworld.com.au , happyhousesitters.com.a u , or aussiehousesitters.com.au . You can also put the word out and look for homes in need through university communities (on general message boards, in residences, in university newspapers), church communities or community centres. Social networking sites like craigslist.org and facebook.com are also worth a try. What advocates say: Finding a gig like this is golden. You'll get free accommodation in exchange for watering some plants and walking a dog. What Granny would say: Why would someone want a stranger in their house? They must be sexual predators! 3. Volunteer and fundraise In a nutshell: Ever considered volunteering on a development project? One of the great things about devoting your time to help a worthy cause overseas is that it may allow you an opportunity to fundraise to support your work. Some volunteer organizations may help you out with room and board, and occasionally flights. Most organizations that do this require a significant commitment of time (one to two years) as well as specialized skills and experience. An alternative is to join a shorter-term project and fundraise. Schools, employers, community organizations, family and friends are all great sources of moral support for most volunteers, and most are happy to help out with a good cause. Some local organizations that support this kind of work include your local Lions Club ( www.lionsclubs.org ), Optimist Club ( www.optimist.org ) or Rotary Club ( www.rotary.org ). What advocates say: Many volunteers are successful in raising enough to cover their out-of-pocket expenses, and even to make a donation to the project they are interested in. Not only will you be making a contribution to a worthy cause, but volunteer travel can be one of the most rewarding ways to see and learn about another part of the world. What Granny would say: It sounds okay, but just don't nag my friends for donations while we're playing bridge. 4. Carpool or hitchhike In a nutshell: You can get on board with someone going in the same direction, or if you have a car, you can look for people to join you -- thereby offsetting fuel costs. Carpooling usually requires some advance planning, as travellers will look to fill their car way in advance of their departure. Some travellers advertise on travel forums ( thorntree.lonelyplanet.com ), and there are websites specifically dedicated to this kind of ride sharing like www.erideshare.com , www.compartir.org and www.hitchhikers.org . Rides can also be advertised at hostels and other venues where travellers congregate. While it requires slightly more planning than hitchhiking, carpooling is likely a safer option. You can meet the person in advance of the trip (preferably in a public place), as well as check their references, photo ID and phone numbers. Though of course, in some parts of the world, such as Cuba, hitchhiking is just part of the way of life. What advocates say: Carpooling and hitching rides are both great ways to meet some local characters, and they're also eco-friendly and cheaper than riding alone. What Granny would say: Going on a trip with someone you met on the computer? Has your mother not taught you anything about your personal safety? 5. Crew a yacht In a nutshell: You don't need to know your port from your starboard in order to help crew a boat. Knowledge of seamanship might make you a shoo-in, but culinary, mechanical or navigational abilities could score you a paid position on board, and often an extra set of hands is enough to earn you working passage on a yacht. If you want to get a feel for the kinds of options available, check out UK-based Crewseekers International: www.crewseekers.net (Note: A membership fee applies). Crewseekers lists many opportunities, including paid positions, shared contribution voyages and working passage trips. If you are up for a bit of adventure -- or happen to find yourself in a port town -- then just get yourself down to the marina and start asking questions. Check out the bars and restaurants, check bulletin boards for ads and consider posting your own. At different times of the year "repositioning crossings" take place -- boat owners have a limited weather window during which time they must move their vessel (hurricane season, anyone?) Get yourself to the right place at the right time, with the right attitude, and you're almost sure to find a vessel to take you on. What advocates say: Haven't you always dreamed of an adventure on the high seas? Treat this adventure like hitchhiking with a real live captain! What Granny would say: Are you crazy? Haven't you seen Pirates of the Caribbean ? 6. Crew a cruise ship In a nutshell: A much less adventurous way to travel at sea, in some respects. But there are about a zillion different jobs available on cruise ships. The best option for short-term contracts is to offer an area of expertise for the education or entertainment of the passengers. There are many websites that offer listings of cruise ship jobs -- some of which are fraudulent -- but most cruise companies list available job opportunities directly on their websites. Get started at www.carnival.com or www.royalcaribbean.com . What advocates say: It's a way to see the world on someone else's dime. What Granny would say: Crew jobs are not all that glamorous: the staff work long hours, stay below deck and are allowed off the ship only very rarely. 7. Transport other people's vehicles In a nutshell: When people move from one place to another, they often have their car sent -- and that's where you come in. Start by inquiring directly with car rental or relocation companies, some of whom need drivers to move vehicles from one city to another in a limited number of days. Checking for ads or advertising your own services in city, community, or university newspaper classified sections could also bring you in contact with a car owner in need of a driver. Try advertising and looking in both the city where you are and in the city that you want to travel to. Australia-based rental companies including Britz ( www.britz.com.au ), and Maui ( www.maui.com.au ) require occasional relocations throughout the year. And at season's end, they often need to move a number of vehicles en-masse to a specific location due to seasonal demand. Keep in mind that many companies require you to be at least 21 years of age. What advocates say: As long as you have some flexibility, this is a simple and cheap solution for getting from point A to B. What your Granny would say: Don't forget to check which side of the road they drive on in Australia! 8. WWOOF it up In a nutshell: World-Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms is an international network of organic farmers who from time to time offer opportunities for volunteers to join them. Contact the WWOOF office in the country you wish to visit (at last count, in November 2007, there were opportunities in 83 different countries). A small membership fee gives you access to lists of member farms in that country. For further information about national branches and membership see www.wwoof.org . What advocates say: It's a good deal: room and board is often provided in exchange for help on the farm. And if you're lucky, they might let you eat some fruit or veg on the house. What Granny would say: Make sure you eat three solid meals a day to keep up your strength and don't forget to wear sunscreen. 9. Get a travel scholarship In a nutshell: "Internationalization" is the buzzword on campus these days, and more and more funding is becoming available for Canadian students who want to study abroad. For a sample of the kinds of funds available, check out www.scholarships.gc.ca , which lists awards for Canadians wanting to study in 50 countries. For graduate study and fieldwork in international development, check out the International Development Research Centre ( www.idrc.ca/awards ). For a listing of higher-education study opportunities and scholarships in 129 countries, see the UNESCO Study Abroad Guide at www.unesco.org/education/studyingabroad/\\... . What advocates say: If you can get one of these grants, you're not only set for your travels, but it will look great on your resume. What Granny would say: Now this sounds like the most sensible way to travel. 10. Fly smart In a nutshell: Budget airlines are virtually a religion in Europe, where few people pay full price for airline tickets. In fact, some airlines--especially those in the United Kingdom--offer international fares for little more than the taxes. You'll be blown away by some of the sales on offer, check out www.ryanair.com , www.easyjet.com or www.flymonarch.com . Similarly, domestic fares within Australia are worth checking out, like www.virginaustralia.com that offers happy hour rates for one hour a day and www.jetstar.com . What advocates say: A $30 ticket to get across Europe? It makes the train seem pricey. What Granny would say: Sounds good. Do they offer a discount for seniors? 11. Trade labour at a hostel In a nutshell: Once you've arrived at your destination, consider approaching a hostel manager and negotiating a deal to exchange some work for your room -- if they're short of staff, you can barter your labour for a free place to stay. An alternative is to apply for a hostel job before you even leave home, especially if you've had experience in the hospitality industry. A number of websites list hostel jobs, like www.hostelworld.com which has a message board. Other sites offer listings on a country-by-country basis -- see, for example, www.backpack.co.nz , which displays job postings within New Zealand. Some hostels may be apprehensive about hiring someone from abroad; depending on the place, some may require you to hold a working visa before your arrival. What advocates say: As long as no money is exchanged, trading your labour for room and board is a good way to get around the visa issue of working in other countries. What Granny would say: It's like slave labour! You should report them if they make you work too hard. 12. Pick up some casual work In a nutshell: If you're looking to stay a little longer, then consider picking up some short-term work overseas. The options are plentiful: you can be an au pair ( www.greataupair.com or www.aupair.com ) or you can do something outdoors like fruit picking or trailmaintenance ( www.anyworkanywhere.com offers listings for fruit picking, but many smaller farmers will only advertise locally). Many countries also offer Canadian youth working holiday visas, where you can travel and pick up any kind of casual work (legally). Check out SWAP ( swap.ca ) who will help you to arrange a working visa in many different countries, or companies like Go Workabout ( goworkabout.com ) who will pre-arrange a seasonal job in Australia for you. What advocates say: You can work your way around the world with odd jobs like these -- it's a win-win situation. What Granny would say: Employers might expect you to work long hours, leaving you little time to sightsee. Maybe it's time you got a real job?! 13. Organize a group tour Most travel companies will offer a discount -- or free travel -- to people who organize a group tour for several people. They commonly refer to them as "group leaders". No, this does not mean that you are responsible for guiding your group of friends around Rome, but rather that you organize who will be going, where they will be going, and when. This one is a no-brainer for teachers and professors (ever wondered why your teacher in high school was happy to accompany 20 teenagers on a trip to Paris?) But it can work for other people too. Check out adventuresincorporated.com or adventures-abroad.com for examples, or enquire with any organization of interest to you. Advocates would say: Great idea! Not only will you get to travel for free, but you can go with your friends. What Granny would say: You can start by organizing my trip to Florida this winter. 14. Take a hard-core challenge If you are the sort of person who would welcome the challenge of climbing to Everest Base Camp to raise money for a charity, this one could be for you. One of the newest trends in travel has seen companies springing up that will help you organize the challenge of your choice -- or join an existing expedition -- all in the name of charity. You do the climb (or other adventure), and raise the sponsors, they take care of the rest. Check out Global Adventure Challenges ( globaladventurechallenges.com ), Across the Divide ( acrossthedivide.com ) or Charity Treks ( charitytreks.ca ). Advocates say: Where's my ice axe? What Granny would say: Why go so far when you can do charity work at the nursing home across the street? 15. Enter contests OK, this may sound like a long shot, but if you're short on cash and long on time you'll be absolutely amazed at how many travel contests are there for the wining. Just Google "travel contests" and you'll get hundreds of pages of results. Travel writing or photography may win you cash or a trip. Airlines, cruise lines, resorts, tourism boards and adventure travel companies all offer up prize trips every so often. If you're not picky about where you go, a little time and energy invested might get you out of here sooner than you think.
OP	I played two PC ports of two big, exciting new games this week. One of them worked. One of them didn't. The two big games in question were Square Enix and United Front's Hong Kong crime game Sleeping Dogs and THQ and Vigil's comic-booky fantasy game Darksiders II . Both games came out on Tuesday, both were released on Xbox 360, PS3 and, in an increasingly uncommon but welcome move, simultaneously on PC (hooray!). But while Sleeping Dogs has a robust, customisable PC version, Darksiders II 's PC port has more than its share of problems. Let's start with the good. Sleeping Dogs is, as Tina raved in her review of the Xbox 360 version , a darned cool game. I've played four or five hours, and I'm enjoying myself quite a bit. I like the story, I like the characters, and I like busting heads and breaking legs in nightclubs. While Sleeping Dogs isn't a graphical powerhouse like The Witcher 2 or Crysis 2 , it's still a darned good-looking game. Its Hong Kong setting is colourful and sprawling, and it's the first time in a good long while that a game has given me that wonderful sense of disoriented tourism that the best open-world games can inspire. I run a middle-of-the-road gaming PC these days, an i5 with 8GB of RAM centered around an AMD Radeon 6870 graphics card. I run Sleeping Dogs somewhere between its middle and high settings, and have got it dialled in to a near-perfect setting. Please enable JavaScript to watch this video. Sleeping Dogs hums along at a solid 60 frames per second, with its HD resolution and long draw-distance bringing Hong Kong to bright, colourful life on my PC. I haven't had time to put together a side-by-side comparison of how the PC version stacks up to consoles, but the friendly folks at Revision3 have made a video (off to the side here) that about sums it up. Everything on PC -- the colours, the framerate, the textures (if you use the PC-exclusive HD texture pack), and the DirectX 11 features to enhance the shadows and anti-aliasing, make the game look and run well on PC. Best of all, it's got a built-in benchmark tool that lets you know how the game is handling your settings without your having to go in and see for yourself. In fact, I used the word "port" in the headline here, but that word raises the ire of many PC gamers -- a "port" is thought to be a shoddy rip of a console game straight to PC, with little thought to the extra horsepower and customisation options afforded by modern DirectX 11 PCs. Sleeping Dogs would be more accurately called a PC version of the game. It's not without its bugs and weirdnessness -- one time, adjusting the graphics caused my characters to "fall into the world" and tumble unendingly until I restarted the game -- but by and large, Sleeping Dogs runs smoothly and looks great. Darksiders II , however, is resolutely a port. And unfortunately, it's not a very good one. I'll start out by saying that I actually don't mind straight-up PC ports of console games. I play most of those kinds of games with a plugged in Xbox controller, and I frequently play them on my big TV. Really, I like when a PC game feels like a console game played in true 1080p. Arkham Asylum on PC, for example, ran so smoothly and cleanly that it almost felt like a different thing than its console sibling, even though it was basically a direct port of the game. So, I was ready for Darksiders II to be a port, but when I booted it up, I was surprised at just how bare-bones the PC version was. (Really, things didn't get off to a good start when the game made me create an account and sign into THQ's proprietary gaming network, blerg, but that's a story for another day.) The in-game menus are essentially indistinguishable from an Xbox 360 game -- I couldn't even get into the settings until I'd played through the opening cinematic, and when I did, I was surprised at what I found. No detail settings, not even a high-medium-low graphics dial. Just one setting for screen resolution and a checkbox for v-sync. I'd seen a lot of screen-tearing in the intro cinematic, so I thought "Well, better turn on v-sync." So I did. I also bumped the resolution up to 1920x1080, since it had defaulted to something much lower. The settings menu stated that I'd need to quit the game and restart it for the changes to take effect (grumble), so I did that, and before long was back in the introductory segment. Despite the fact that I'd turned on v-sync, at 1080p screen tearing had become rampant . Huh. I went into the settings again and checked the v-sync box. Yup, it was checked. Double-huh. It would appear that the v-sync option in Darksiders II does not work, at least for me. I started playing the game, but the tearing was so intense that I couldn't get into it. Every time I'd pan the camera around my character's head, the screen would roll and clip onto itself, a spastic dance of graphical jitters that were distracting and disorienting. Eventually, I found something of a solution -- I bumped the resolution all the way down to 1280x720, where the tearing became much less noticeable. You might notice that's 720p, or, the same resolution at which most console games run. And even then, the tearing is minimised, but still present. It's a shame that the only way to make the PC version of Darksiders II run OK on my machine is to effectively turn it into the Xbox 360 version. I don't ask for much in a PC port! But I do ask to be able to run the game in my monitor's native resolution without a fuss. Reader Andy Pavolillo wrote in with this involved but theoretically feasable workaround for the V-sync and stutter issues, but it requires an NVIDIA graphics card, so I haven't been able to try it. Regardless, that kind of involved solution shouldn't be necessary for something as basic as v-sync! Some perusal of both the Steam forums and the official Darksiders II forums have turned up a lot of gamers having problems similar to mine -- the nonfunctional v-sync option, in particular. Other PC owners, however, report that while the game may be lacking customisation options, it is at least running smoothly and without graphical issues. It sounds as though AMD cards have the v-sync problem while on some NVIDIA graphics cards, v-sync works as it should. But the overarching vibe among PC gamers is one of discontent. Mouse and keyboard control customisation is lackluster, and perhaps even worse, the camera auto-centers on to Death (the protagonist)'s back. There's no "free-look" option when using a mouse, resulting in a vertiginous flying camera that players must fight in order to look around while moving. A large part of the anger is that some PC gamers feel they were mislead -- people working on the game had ensured PC owners that the .config file that would allow them to tinker and tweak the game to their liking would be available, but now that the game has launched, it's nowhere to be found. In a post to the game's official forums , community manager Matthew Everett (to his and Vigil/THQ's credit) apologized for giving gamers bad information: During the Community Summit both Jay Fitzloff and I (Mathew Everett) were under the impression that full .config files and final keyboard/mouse and controller hookups were going to work as promised when the PC version of the game launched. That was the plan at the time from a specifications perspective. Unfortunately, especially at the end of the development cycle, sometimes things change at the last minute, and this was one of them. This puts us in an uncomfortable spot as we were acting on the best information we had at the time, and it has turned out not to be in the final game (at this point). Since it was always the intention to implement these features, as I type this, the development team is checking to see what items can get added into the game. While I can't promise what can be done, I can promise we are working with the proper teams and have expressed the importance of including them in a patch. When I asked THQ about the problems with the PC version, a spokesperson told me that "Vigil is tracking these issues closely and is keeping their collective ear close to the forums." And to their credit, a first patch has already been released for the PC version, addressing a number of game-crashing bugs more serious than anything I've encountered. This is all a real shame, since Darksiders II is a fun game. Most reviews, including Kate's review for Kotaku , report it to be a fun and generally successful mashup of Prince of Persia , Zelda and Diablo . Everything I've played so far backs that up. But even when reviewing the PlayStation 3 version, Kate advised that players not buy the game just yet, as a number of significant bugs detract enough that it'd be worth waiting until they get patched. I asked Kate about screen-tearing issues in the console version, and she said that the display was fine on her version -- the bugs she ran into were mostly functional. Of course, this tale of woe is nothing new for PC gamers -- it's common for this sort of thing to happen. But the contrast between the two games feels like a great example of how to do a PC version right, and how to get it wrong. Furthermore, there's a chance that you'll get Darksiders II to run perfectly fine on your system. But it also might be a mess. It's great that Vigil is working to fix their game, but when it comes down to it, a game shouldn't be released in the state that Darksiders II on the PC was. We PC players may grump about having to wait an extra couple weeks for a PC version, but if that's what it takes to give us a game that works immediately after we install it, so be it. The overarching narrative of this week has been " Sleeping Dogs or Darksiders II ?" Console gamers can't really go wrong, but PC gamers have a clearer choice -- pick up Sleeping Dogs now, and you'll get a robust PC gaming experience with HD textures and all manner of DirectX 11 bells and whistles. But you might want to hold off on Darksiders II for a little while, at least until Vigil makes good on their promises to get the game up to snuff. Share Tags Discuss When I got sleeping dogs on Steam the other day, it crashed upon the first running and had graphical glitches coming out its proverbial dogs ass. I reset my PC (Duh, I should ALWAYS do this after an installation in theory) and voila, not one single problem since. It's obvious it was also designed with the PC in mind. Thanks for the heads up about DS2, will now wait til it hits bargain basement prices on Steam before even indulging in the pc version. I hate to use the buzzword "fun", but I have to use that in Darksiders 2's case, as the game is so damn fun, that I couldn't care less about it's port problems. It's aesthetically pleasing as well, even though the graphics aren't all that great. As long as a port can be at native resolutions and run a smooth 60+ fps, that's all that matters to me. Sometimes I think PC gamers sit on the graphics options for games longer than actually playing the game. Spot on. I'm sure the game is fun, the reason for this article is, why even make a bloody PC version if they aren't going to take advantage of the PC's features? Why not just play it on your xbox or whatever Giving someone a port of a game for PC and then limiting it to 720p is like giving an admiral a tugboat instead of a destroyer. If they cant even get 1080p running without screen tearing (assuming kirk has the hardware to support it) then thats a pretty big issue and shouldnt of been released. Why should someone 'pay for/release' something that cant do what it should? It's not limited to that and as he stated native resolutions ie that of the users monitor There are some annoying gripes I have with the game primarily that when in the inventory screen(which you might spend a bit of time in) has a model of death that is ridiculously low resolution(way worse than the ingame model) which is stupid considering they already have a higher resolution model to use. But otherwise the game is great you wanna get technical the texture resolutions are a bit too low which is a shame because the actual world has had some awesome aesthetics built for it. With high res textures it would make the games world look amazing instead it just looks good. But good is nothing to be ashamed of Did you read the article? He couldn't even play it on low settings without the graphics being all glitchy.. so it's not even basic graphic options being performed, let alone the ones you're going on about. It's certainly not aesthetically pleasing when the screen is tearing itself to shreads. Yes, what you've said is all the matters but in this case, it's not happening and that's also what matters. I personally haven't had any problems with Darksiders 2 on PC. I was disappointed by the lack of video settings but it's still an enjoyable game. Plus, I use an xbox controller when playing most third-person shooters on PC so the controls are fine. So, you run the game on console resolutions while using a console controller... why not just play the damn game on a console? The issue is that a PC version should take advantage of all the advantages a PC has over a console I'm running it on an AMD HD 6880 at 1080p with no issues whatsoever graphically. I haven't encountered any bugs either, and it looks pretty lush at that resolution, with the glaring exception of Death in the menu screen being unbelievably low res/textured. You can play Darksiders 2 at 2560x1440, that in no way is a console resolution. Gamepad doesn't immediately mean console trash, some games just play better on a game pad. You can't partially press WASD keys, therefore, you can only ever run or nothing. Control sticks have this thing called a throttle. DS2 has been running flawlessly in 1080p with no tearing or any bugs (graphical or functional) so far. Im only up to the second world/area though. I still have to say, graphically its pretty horrible as far as current pc games go. I can look past most things, but PLEASE give us an option for better shadows, these shadows are worse then the shadows in vanilla Skyrim at release. To be fair, Sleeping Dogs and Dark Stalkers 2 are both priced comparitively. 69 brand new in shops and 49 each on Steam. Damn good pricing on both. Not arguiing any other of your points at all as they're incredibly valid, just saying give DS2 credit for being a budget priced AAA title. I dunno I have my fair share of issues with the PC version of Sleeping Dogs. Such as not being able to make it full screen (only plays in windowed mode), a couple of white screen crashes and the fact that I can't map movement to the arrow keys. Yes I am one of those people who still use arrow keys, I have tried to switch to WASD but I find it much more uncomfortable and occasionally get cramps :( Yeah, i tried that. it just reverts straight back to window mode... also edited the displaysettings.xml to try and force it there... it worked once then after the game crashed it wont go into full screen. So its hardly a great port. I appreciate the extra work with the DX11 and High res textures (though you have to download them separately) but something as simple as fully customizable controls and being able to play games at full screen is a pretty big letdown. All that said i am still enjoying the game and Darksiders 2 for that matter (though on PS3) This isn't an arrogant post. Have you thought of getting a wired 360 controller? Sleeping Dogs plays beautifully with it. Plus the ergonomics of the controller may suit your hand as well if cramps are an issue. Sleeping Dogs is fun, buuuuuttttttt.... It feels incomplete. It's one of those games where you can tell its been through various different teams with various different idea's. When they switched teams and didn't have time to fully flesh out the idea's, they applied patch work to cover the holes. Its very good patchwork for the most part, but it does show in some places, such as the girlfriends feature. Most of the game looks like it was intended to be released with a fully fleshed out story for each girlfriend, and the option's that went with them, except after the first mission you get a few lines of dialog as the screen fades out, most of which makes absolutely no sense with the story up to that point. Furthermore, there are parts where you'll notice a phonecall come in from one particular girlfriend, which then disappears and is replaced by one of the main NPC's. It looks like they missed some code for cutting it out. This kinda happens in many places in the game. The ending is a good one, I think the game was intended to go much longer, but BAM, there's the ending. A shame really. Its and awesome game, but those plotholes and obvious patchwork to feature's I'd like to have seen more of really bite at my sensibilities. Playing DS2 on a PS3 and have had my fair share of frame rate chop as well, if anyone who just got through the dungeon where you have to light the orbs to clear the corruption from the 3 water flows can report whether they got sub 5fps when they got near the glowing orbs while the skybox was visible, I am curious to know whether it is a PS3 thing or whether it extends to the xbrick and PC too? Maybe they should have paid more attention to the development of the game instead of shamelessly "pumping up" the media (the kotaku article about the author recieving a darksiders 2 tombstone made me worry about the game) maybe it wouldn't have been so bad. Sleeping Dogs is NOT a great port. The fact that it's functional is great, but the UI and controls are horrible. It can't really be played effectively with a keyboard and mouse. It's the little things which shit you off, like limited keybinds, inconsistent menus (can use escape or mouse-click for exiting/entering SOME menus, but not all of them), the fact that both mousewheel AND moving the mouse scrolls through menu options, and fight with each other, the wild and dramatic difference in the sweeping drive-camera that makes 3-point turns almost impossible, compared to the tug-of-war you have to play with the on-foot camera, constantly dragging your mouse in the direction you want the camera to TRY and face, as if you were using an analogue stick which DOESN'T run out of room. These things are not fucking rocket science, but apparently the port team couldn't get it done. I've been playing Darksiders 2 on Xbox and was loving it until 9 hours in I hit a gamebreaking glitch and now have to start the whole thing over again. Looking at THQ community forums, i'm far from being alone. Very poor form THQ. Sleeping Dogs is awesome, plays well and nothing is overly tedious yet. I bouht Snipr Elite V2, it was 66% on steam so about $20, shit it is fun, there isn't a whole lot to it but do enjo the xray kill shots Yeah, crying babies, those consumers. It's like cars! Who expects THOSE to work on day one? Jesus. The manufacturers need to get your purchase to pay for mechanics to come out to your house and finish things up as they figure them out first. Just because a tiny percentage of the population dies in fiery auto-explosion is a shit reason to dump on released cars. The realities of the business are they can only spend so long in R&D and testing before the manufacturer HAS to push them out the door, working or not. First I was going to get it for XBOX 360, because I like to avoid the DRM crap if I can help it. I also figured the game wasnt worth going through all the effort to install, and configure it on PC - I reserve that for games like Crysis, Battlefield, and even Dead Space. But then, abotu a month ago, I changed the preorder to the PC version, because I came to the conclusion that the games E3 showing, prioveded me with the image of a game that was much more epic than it's predessor, and so 'why get the XBOX 360 version, when you can play it with the same controller, but with better graphics on PC?'. Then 3 weeks ago, a friend suggested I get it for PS3, since the first game was best on PS3, and since, the GAMESTOP was bumping preorders to Limited Edition's, and with all that content, it's usually better to get the game for console, because you have less worry about losing that DLC in the future because of instability, or harddrive crashes. But really, what sold me on the PS3 version, was simply: the Dualshock 3. Considering how the God of War frachise 'feels' on PS3, and how much better Dantes Inferno & Castlevania: LOS was on the PS3, I figured a God of War clone would probably best be played on a PS3. Right? Now since the games been out I've heard that the XBOX 360 edition has a lower framerate than the PS3 and PC edition, and sudden FPS drops!? Even more so the XBOX 360 edition has noticable Screen tearing. NOW, I'm basically reasing here, that the PC edition has the SAME issues - just WORSE - AND aside from an adjustable video output, it lacks any desernable graphic settings? Well, Well, Well! It turns out I picked correctly. I know when this game cameout the PS3 version immediately got flack for its bugs, some control scheme layout issues, and it's sudden (and frequent) 'loading' in the middle of the game. But it only took a few days for people to start complaining of all this other stuff, that isnt even a issue in the PS3 version. My PS3 edition has '0' framerate drops, and runs between 30 - 60 fps (it isnt locked) depending on the area, and has absolutely '0' - Z.E.R.O. - screen tearing. And beyond the complaints of Bugs in my version, I personally havent incounted even a single one! I'm no alon in this either - more folks are playing the game without issues on PS3, than people who are. And any future patches will most likely fix any bugs that they have experienced, and mostlikely will fix the frequent 'loading' issue on the PS3 (perhaps with an optional HDD install. I'd also like to say, that I purchased a 2.5" (arent they ALL 2.5"?) Patriot SSD pretty cheap, and installed it in my PS3 yesterday. And even though the game doesnt have a HDD intall, I did notice a reduction in the frequency of ingame loading. So overall, I'm very pleased about my PS3 choice - and I highly advice any of you, who are on the fense about this awesome game to go ahead and get it for PS3. I love my gaming rig as much as the next guy, but some games just either arent worth a port, or are simply 'better' on console. Darksiders II is clearily a Console game, and is best experienced NOW, and on the PS3. Why wait for a update to play it on PC, when you arent even going to get anything beyond a minor bump in resolution? I could understand if we where taking about Medal of Honor: Warfighter here, or Sleeping Dogs (aka: Streets of Hong Kong), but Darksiders II, with its low res textures, and WoW art style? Not worth the wait or trouble in my opinon. Eveyone, get it for PS3 if it's an option for you. The XBOX 360 looks worse, and has annoying controls, and the PC edition is broken at this point. I can't understand why PC gamers are whining about a bad PC port - Vigil and THQ are having troubles, and they probably realised that creating a good PC port would require far more expense than they could justify. The good thing about developing for consoles is that you know the exact hardware configuration that the game will need to run under; for PC there are thousands of different configurations that need to be tested for and optimised for. Making a full-blown PC port likely would have meant sacrificing quality in the console version, which they were not prepared to do. Hell, I'm six hours in and I've seen screen tearing and full blown freezes on the Xbox version, so I hate to think how bad the PC version could be, but remember the situation the devs are in, and have some freaking empathy. Calmly let them know the problems (which they're likely already aware of by now) and keep your bitching to a minimum - it doesn't help anyone, and actively helps to portray PC gamers (and, by extension, gamers in general) as whiny kids, which is the last thing we need in this country. From what I've heard, they didn't get the graphics right in many cases, tho - framerate issues, screen-tearing, low-res textures, crashes on many graphics cards. As far as I can tell, they put as much effort into the graphics as they put into making the kb/m controls usable. I honestly think they would have been better off not releasing the PC version at all, as all it says about the game is "you really should be playing this on a console". It would've saved them a lot of time, effort and money, and probably caused far less backlash...
NA	News Local Jayson Stewart, a teacher at Espanola High School, a Township of Sables-Spanish Rivers councillor and producer of Spartan Youth Radio -- an extra-curricular club at Espanola High School, will be staring in Black Forest as Isaac , the antagonist. Distant Field Productions, an independent film company, headed to the North Shore on Aug. 12 to begin filming scenes for their latest independent film, Black Forest. Jayson Stewart, a teacher at Espanola High School, a Township of Sables-Spanish Rivers councillor and producer of Spartan Youth Radio -- an extra-curricular club at Espanola High School, will be staring in Black Forest as Isaac , the antagonist. Stewart has many years of experience in theatre such as being an: actor, director, producer, backstage crew, sound engineer and promoter. He has played numerous background characters in film, specializes in voice acting (and can do an incredible Sean Connery impersonation that would make one think the legendary actor was on set) and does whatever he can to promote the Sables-Spanish Rivers area to the film community. He's been working closely with director David Briggs in finding the perfect locations to film Black Forest. Stewart got a taste for acting in Grade 8 when he a friend dared him to try out for a role in a school production of Scrooge, A Christmas Carol. He won the role of Jacob Marley. "I realized that the adrenalin of acting, the addictive thrill of letting a completely different character take over, of immersing myself into the life of someone else was something I enjoyed," Stewart explained, when asked what got him into acting. In 2010, Stewart brought some students to the set of Phase One, a medical horror thriller that filmed in Sudbury. "I was thrilled to witness how a movie was made. I brought students to Markstay for the filming of A Little Bit Zombie and then, last fall, brought an entire bus load of kids to appear as extras in The Lesser Blessed." The first film Stewart appeared in was The Truth, starring Andy Garcia, Eva Longoria, Devon Bostick, Kevin Durand and Forest Whittaker in which Stewart played a cameraman in a pivotal scene with Bostick. In another scene with Garcia and Durand, he can only be seen as a fuzzy 'blob' in the background. "It's cool to say 'I did a scene with Andy Garcia' even if I was just in the background," Stewart said with a grin. The Truth has not been released yet. Stewart also played a teacher in Lesser Blessed. So what about his character in Black Forest? His character Isaac is his first starring role in a film. Isaac and his partner in crime, Clay, are the antagonists and extremely creepy. At first Isaac is helpful and kind, but then leads the two young stars of the film into the depths of terror within the haunting realm of the Black Forest. He has lived in the back woods for most of his life with one foot in the real world where he's creepy and odd, but not dangerous; yet in his own backward world he is a violent man with 'oddball' conspiracy theories and has plans to build a better world. So what are Stewart's movie plans for the future? "Though I've crossed 'be in a movie' off my (bucket) list, I have the bug and will be pursuing other roles. I will never quit teaching, but will certainly be involved in other productions. "As a municipal councillor, I will continue working to promote this area for film locations. Director David Briggs was most impressed with the variety of scenes he could do in Sables-Spanish Rivers and I'm hoping to use his film as bait to draw in other productions. As an actor, it's certainly an exciting time to live in Northern Ontario." Nicholas Piche, of Espanola, was a last minute replacement actor. A former student of Stewart's, he quickly agreed to join the cast when the actor playing forest ranger Dale McQueen dropped out. Piche was in the middle of working on his acting resume when he received the call that he not only had his first movie gig, but that it also had lines and a murder scene. He stayed with the team for the entire 24-hour marathon shoot filmed in Algoma Mills and helped as a lighting technician, sound operator and prop master. The Chutes Provincial Park was the first stop for the North Shore filming. Cinematographer, Torin Laugen, filmed parts of the opening scenes with stars, Marie-Jose (MJ) Dionne who plays Bree, and France Ihrat who plays Jess (character name not official yet). Due to a few minor bumps in casting, the script had to be changed. Instead of featuring a couple camping, now it will be two best friends. The interaction between the two young women is flawless. Many of the scenes filmed locally were small, but will ultimately set the mood of the movie. From the Chutes the team travelled to the bridge coming into Massey on Highway 17 and then to Ellen's Place for another small, but crucial scene between the two actresses. While the scene was small it took quite some time to film. As an independent company, Distant Film Production works with one camera and most scenes are not done in one shot. In fact, it can take many shots, from many angles and sometimes, many hours. And much debate between the cinematographer and the director. Some scenes were shot 'on the fly' with no set script. But when a potential opportunity presents itself the camera is pulled out and anything can be used as a tool to get just the right shot, for example using a minivan with its side door open as a dolly. After wrapping up at Ellen's Place the team moved on the Elliot Lake and then Algoma Mills to film more scenes.
OP	The New Normal Review: Making the Choir Cringe? Credit where credit's due: Perhaps no current TV producer has found so much mainstream success by pursuing offbeat or fringe-appeal subject matter as Ryan Murphy . Starting with his perhaps too-clever-for-The WB teen show Popular and continuing with the disturbing psychosexual dramedy Nip/Tuck , the horror melodrama American Horror Story , and the primetime musical (!) after-school special Glee , few can argue that Murphy makes safe creative decisions. Regardless of how you feel about those shows (or, more pressingly, whether those shows actually remain good beyond their first seasons), Murphy deserves our respect for bringing something new to the table with each new project. That trend continues with The New Normal , his single-camera sitcom created with Ali Adler for NBC's rebooted comedy lineup. On paper, a show about two gay men who hire a surrogate to carry their baby simply could not have been greenlit on a major network before 2012 and probably by no producer with less clout than Murphy. But while The New Normal is certainly a watershed moment in television history, it also bears some unmistakable -- and unfortunate -- Murphy trademarks. Namely, it not only sings to the choir, it frequently makes us cringe . At one point in the pilot, our heroine surrogate Goldie asks the two fathers-to-be Bryan and David (the fantastic Andrew Rannells and Justin Bartha ) if they'd like to be present when she gets inseminated. Bryan responds matter-of-factly that no, he'd rather not, since to him women's genitalia looks like "tarantula faces." Taken out of context, that's an awful-yet-hilarious thing to say to a woman, but in the context of The New Normal , we're supposed to like Bryan, not write him off as a woman-fearing clich of a gay man. This, after at least three jokes in which Bryan objectifies an infant as simply an accessory and openly wishes for a child that is "blonde, skinny, and doesn't cry." Again, perfectly funny jokes for an unlikable buffoon in a Christopher Guest film, but this show asks us to be on Bryan's side , and more importantly, to sympathize with the plight of childless gay couples. It's an uncomfortable fit, particularly for a gay viewer like me who desires nothing more than for gay people to be featured in lead roles where their gayness is not (1) their defining personality trait, or (2) a tired clich. So yeah, I'm in the choir, Ryan Murphy, but these portrayals of gay men are making me consider resigning. After premiering the pilot online and then running it after The Voice on Monday, last night NBC debuted The New Normal 's second episode, "Sofa's Choice," in the show's official timeslot of Tuesday at 9:30pm, billing it as the series' official premiere. We at TV.com love to talk about the differences between first and second episodes, since second episodes usually feature the new, permanent sets the show will be filming on, as well as a more locked-down cast and sensibility. In many ways, the second episode is the real indicator of a show's quality or longevity, so I'm pleased to say the second episode of The New Normal showed a marked improvement. Most of the things that bugged me in the pilot were improved upon in the second episode: Both Bryan and David got fleshed out; Goldie made more sense as a character; Goldie's wise-beyond-her-years daughter was made more weird -beyond-her years (via her truly funny obsession with Grey Gardens ); and even Bryan sort of toned down his jokes that might make us doubt his ability to be a good father. It was a start. Unfortunately, even with those improvements, some serious red flags remain. In particular Ellen Barkin 's increasingly tiresome Nana character, who in the pilot could have gone either way, but is now officially one of TV's worst new characters. It's not even that she's a poor man's rip-off of Arrested Development 's Lucille Bluth (down to the stolen joke about gay people doing her hair), it's that her hateful one-liners are so unfunny and uninspired, it makes Goldie less likable just for even putting up with her. (Seriously, lots of people have cut ties with family members for less hateful behavior.) I understand that Nana's a villain, but I guess it just rings false that she'd put her hate so front-and-center in every conversation she has. Women like this should be fakey, scheming, and manipulative -- not loud, racist blowhards. If Nana isn't toned down soon, this show could become unwatchable quickly. Same goes for NeNe Leakes ' Rocky character, who initially served as a charming counterpoint to Bryan's finicky ways, but in the second episode couldn't articulate a punchline to save her life. At one point Nana barged in on Rocky while she was on the toilet (this show does love its potty humor) and questioned whether the bathroom shouldn't be whites-only. Or something? I didn't even get it! What California resident in 2012 openly makes pre-segregation insults? And rather than fly into the righteous rage we as viewers thirsted for, Rocky just sort of muttered something and the scene was over. Ugh. Pointless. Don't get me wrong, The New Normal has all the ingredients for a classic comedy series: An insanely talented cast, rewardingly clever dialogue, attempts at emotional depth, and especially a bravery in how it addresses certain political topics at a time when public opinion about them is still being formed. This could very well prove to be a television show -- like All in the Family before it -- that television historians will look back on as era-defining. That is, if it doesn't implode from lack of ideas. I'm not sure if the gestation and birth of a single baby is enough to hinge many seasons of a show on, and it's worrisome that BOTH of the first two episodes dealt with whether Goldie was even pregnant . (Spoiler: She is.) But as long as the characters continue to evolve into believable people (witty, intelligent, hilarious believable people), The New Normal 's prospects look pretty good. I may currently be eying the exit, but for now, I suppose, my robes stay on. though some stuff is really cliche and stereotypical, as a person having a lot, quite a lot of gay friends, I have seen more than a couple of examples of both characters in real life with actions and lines that would make all of you roll eyes if you have seen or heard them on TV. While I agree that the Nana character is beyond tolerable -and is the only thing I would like to see changed in this show- the rest does not bother me at all.. 1st reaction,too many sterotypes. but that is how tv is. one gay man "more normal" the other a depiction of wacky disfunction wrapped in a plastic ken doll that thinks it is barbie..funny maybe,but this may only be what people on the coasts see. add the sit-com elavation and it seems like amos and andy(too sensitive?... maybe))i think it is offensive to gay men. look at thr logo network,nothing but drag and sex with a str8 woman,cute?obnoxious. it is not representative and reinforces sterotypes. a str8 female friend of mine liked it esp 2nd ep. so we had this discussion. most gay people walk down the street unnoticed. and the ones that fit the sterotype of a?sissy"take the abuse in large doses. does this help or hinder progress. all in the family was about sterotypes too and almost everybody loved it.if anyone can pull this off,ryan may be the guy. hopefully too early to tell for me anyhow. more less I saw the third episode as well, and I can't say that I enjoy the show, Guys with babies are funnier. I actually was laughing out loud there, but here.. at most it is a smile on my lips but that disappears quickly. I dislike Nana, the gay couple, the know-it-all teen, and can't say I love Goldie either. Everything is too fake and I do appreciate the message the show tries to send, but please then, be more like scrubs in the first three seasons, not only funny but add some sentimental thoughts and reflect more serioulsy on the topic here. Make the characters feel more real instead of this barbie-ken world, it is plastic. The best gay character I have seen ever was Rubicons' Kale Ingram (Arliss Howard) which was prortrayed superbly. But of course that was a drama and not a comedy. All the characters just feels like it is something we all have seen over and over again and despite it is 2012 the same stereotypes that we always have had remains the same, so it doesnt even feels fresh anymore. more less The gay community needs a resounding voice that will show us in a positive light and not make a mockery of our lives. If you want to see the REAL new normal, check out "The New American Family" on blog.com! There's a new story being told in a very real way! This show is a desperate rip-off of Modern Family, except without the clever writing, engaging character dynamic, and humor which doesn't rely on constant rapid-fire pop culture references. Cam on Modern Family and Bryan on The New Normal are both effeminate gay characters on TV. But the difference is Cam's character on Modern Family was actually well-written, likable, and most importantly, FUNNY. Even though he initially came across as a "stereotypical queen," his character over time revealed aspects of his character which added depth and defied the viewers preconceptions. I'm skeptical that The New Normal will let it's own characters outgrow their stereotypical molds, considering how Ryan Murphy handles the lack of character continuity on Glee, having them go through heavy-handed life-changing "lessons" only to revert to one-dimensional twits in the next episode as if none of it mattered. It's tiresome, and even out of the gate, I get the same feeling with The New Normal. I find Bryan on The New Normal incredibly unlikeable, but worst of all, just plain unfunny. And the rest of the ensemble, nor the mediocre writing does nothing to help balance that out to create a dynamic of a show that's enjoyable. This show would have been groundbreaking in the 90s, but we've gotta have more than just rapid-fire pop culture references and tired stereotypes about gay men being into fashion and antiques. Being gay myself, there's nothing about the gay-oriented humor on this show that is particularly fresh or funny. And you'd think a promising storyline of a gay couple + surrogacy would be prime comedic territory. What an absolute misfire. more less And can I just add that the "joke" about lesbians in last night's episode was completely inappropriate and Ryan Murphy, as a gay man, should be completely ashamed of himself for including such an ugly "joke." By the way, Price - Love you "on" Teen Wolf - still loving you here! Thanks! - I fully agree that if this show had not come from Ryan Murphy, it never would've seen the light of day. - Remember when Obama first got elected, and anyone who didn't like him was deemed racist, even if they had legitimate reasons? And then eventually, even the most hardcore supporters became jaded once the "new" concept got old? I feel like this show will have the same effect (no thanks to Salt Lake City), except replace "racist" with "***phobe." - I was shocked to discover that "Nene Leakes" is an actress, and not a treasonous website as I originally thought. Upon viewing her work, I think I'd prefer the website...at least that would be useful to somebody. - I'm not sure how long ago these episodes were filmed, but let's hope we never see Ellen Barkin looking like she did at the Roseanne Roast. Ew. - I don't care how wise Shania is beyond her years (or every other character's years, for that matter), it's still illegal for a 9 year-old to engage in social networking. - Didn't know Price was gay. Learn something new every day, I guess....+ more less The second episode was alright. Almost completely agree with the review. Nana is just awfull, but maybe this discussion is what Rany Murphy is aiming for, or Murphy is under the impression that she has to that mean and hatefull for her eventual redemption to have an greater impact. I wonder why this show hasn't peeked to ABCs Happy Endings for portrayal of gay characters. When describing Max there are so many adjectives that pop in my head before gay. That makes a character. For Bryan and David one would start with "Well, first of all they are gay......" I loved it. I agree that Nana is way too hateful of a character but I don't agree that Goldie should be expected to cut ties with her. At the end of the day, she is her family and Nana loves her. If she didn't, she wouldn't care what Goldie was doing with her body. Her hatefulness clearly isn't rubbing off on Goldie or her daughter and while I believe she should distance herself from Nana for her and the sake of her child, cutting her out of her life is extreme. You don't have to agree with all of your family's opinions to love them. My father is a racist (not a hateful one but he does say off-colour things). I don't agree with what he says and I love him in spite of it but at the end of the day, he loves me and would do anything for me. Should I cut him out of my life because we have different opinions on equality? more less This review is right on par with my own; while there are some good things in there, it tends to just be a little too much. Ryan Murphy needs to tone down a lot of the characters, and could full on get rid of NeNe Leakes' character without affecting the quality of the show. If they don't tone down Ellen Barkin's character substantially in the next 2 episodes, I'm not sure I'll be able to continue watching. Her one-liners aren't funny or original or clever; they're just hateful. I laughed a few times but I agree that this show is still finding its footing and could improve. I liked the flashback/present day club scenes the best, I thought those were the right amount of funny and accurate. Nana could be toned down but I think Ellen Barkin is still pretty funny. She was best when coaching Goldie's boyfriend Clay on how to win Goldie back. I like the little girl a lot too. I don't know, I think I like it, it seems to have a lot of heart to it and definitely has its funny moments, but particularly in the pilot the stereotypes were awful. I especially didn't like the way he spoke about a baby like it was a fashion accessory. I was excited for a new ryan murphy as i'm such a fan of all his previous works but this show is a fail. It just falls flat, the humour is contrived and too stereotypical. It feels like im watching a documentary on two gay dudes trying to get a baby, and for that melodrama I would rather go to TLC. Cam and Mitchel from modern family are far more entertaining to watch and have portrayed this storyline better already. It had promise on paper but fails to deliver anything special on tv, a whole season of this would be far too tedious. In the discard pile it goes This show is typical of way NBC is failing in the ratings. The has no appeal to the general audience. A small group may enjoy the one-lined humor; The vast audience will not relate. NBC go back to the drawing board. I get that everybody seems to think that one of the gay character is so STEREOTYPICAL... But am I the only one that thinks that Justin Bartha's character is the perfect match to this stereotype? You have one guy who is everything that we expect... and then you have another guy who is a jock and a doctor and doesn't understand any of the "gay things" that his partner does... I think it's perfect. The show is about throwing stereotypes into your face and then making you think about them. In this instance, "Oh, look, a flamboyant gay man!" and then "Oh, look, a really attractive sexy guy that girls probably would fawn over, but too bad, he's gay." At least, I would totally crush on Justin Bartha's character and then be totally let down to find out he's not into my gender. Anywho, I'll continue watching this show for Justin Bartha and because there is NO LAUGH TRACK, THANK GOD. At least, until I lost interest. more less First, Nana isn't a California resident; I'm pretty sure they're from Ohio. Second, I completely disagree with your characterization of Nana as the villain. The bitch got out her gun when her granddaughter's husband was cheating; yes she's a bigot but she followed them all the way to California. She's lonely and I see a lot of potential. The joke makes no more sense with the person being from OH since that state didn't have segregation before the advent of civil rights. That said, I think Ellen Barkin completely pulls off her character. Like every other character on the show, she has a few human moments mixed in with being completely over the top. Nene Leakes, on the other hand, seems to have only one gear as an actress and it's really tiresome. Perhaps that's because she isn't really an actress. Yeah, because one of Ryan's no apologies stereotypes that he never subverts is that if you don't live in New York or California you are racist, ***phobic, clueless, and scared of anything "different," they have no concept of fashion and they stopped watching television when it went color. As a gay man I am flummoxed by all the gay stereotypes on TV. The way The New Normal puts gay characters and men in the role of being feminine and lady like. The clothes the attitudes of the characters is clumping a group of people together. I Don't Care for Ryan Murphy or his show's and this is another to add to the pile of garbage shows. He's gay doesn't he know he is adding to the problem when you make a show like this. The show shouldn't be "The New Normal" It should be called The Same Ignorance! Far more troubling than Nana's idiotic racist jokes was Nene Leakes saying, "This is why my people spank." You can write Nana off as a caricature, but a black woman saying, "Hey, black people beat their children" is harder to justify. I'd say the worst part about it was that it wasn't even funny, but that would be a lie. Saying black people hit their kids is worse. 1) The couple wanting the kid is "too perfect." Their relationship lacks any sense of realness. There is no conflict. Where there is conflict, there is comedy. Right now, these two gay men are about as exciting as a new can of paint. 2) Nene Lekes: Her talent is being wasted. Her character lacks any sense of realness. Bless Ryan's heart for wanting to give a sister a chance. But he should have been bold with his choice and made one of the leads a Black guy and Nene his disapproving and oftentimes over-bearing sister. Nene would also be great as the BOSS of Bryan rather than his assistant - and the tension would be that she less interested in him being a daddy and more concerned about him helping her achieve some outrageous goal of hers. 3) Decide what kind of show you want to be. I fear the producers of this show are too caught in trying to present a message. Take a lesson from Will and Grace and just have FUN with it. 4) Ellen Barkin is awesome! Again, she is boring as the "voice of the Right" - a woman of her experience and talent should be the "crazy mom" of one of the gay guys! Perhaps the conflict would be that she wants the baby more than her son. Just bring some real tension to her role. Right now, every scene with her is predictable and therefore, boring. 5) Be Creative! Come on, Ryan! Come on, Allison! Give us something to talk about the next day. Televison should be fun! 6) I don't know about you, but I'm soooooo over the precocious female teen. How many shows have we seen this character? A million? It would have been tons more interesting if Goldie had a son she was trying to raise who was really against what his mom was doing - and each episode the audience would be tasked with trying to understand why. Again, add some real tension to Goldie's immediate family. Sometimes I feel like I'm just watching an old episode of Brothers and Sisters. 7) Sally Field needs to be a guest! But she so needs to play a comic version of herself! The New Normal needs to surprise us each week with someone playing against type. While this show doesn't need to be as zany as say a "Happy Endings" - it definitely needs to stop taking itself so serious. We got Anderson Cooper for that. 8) We need some "MESSY." Perhaps all this baby planning can be interrupted by a Hot new neighbor who catches one of the guy's eyes and brings into doubt the stability of their relationship? Again, what kind of show does The New Normal wish to be? I say if you're going to write the show like a gay version of Desperate Housewives, then GO FOR IT. If not, make it that zany comedy and turn Nene and Ellen loose! Show the awkward progression of these two wonderful women becoming "Besties!" See, I'm laughing already! 9) Stop trying to be "The New Normal" - just be a show about people living their lives in this day and age! Think about this - and you'll get what I'm saying. If not, call me. Maybe. 10) Go back and start at #1 until you get it right -- otherwise, this show won't be around much longer. And that would be just sad. Peace! more less
NA OP	Share Article "A lot of people hate me... I don't know why." Jonah Mowry is 14. He made this video four months ago after being severely bullied at school. He wanted to share his story with the world and let his classmates who bullied him know he wasn't going away. It went viral. It's powerful. Since the video went viral, Jonah has written this: To all my friends and supporters, I made this video 4 months ago just before school was about to start. I was 13. It was a very emotionally dark time in my life. I made the video at 4:00am in the morning; I hadn't been sleeping at night for a long time, too many things going on in my head. I was dreading going back to school and I had not come out to my family yet. Only my closest friends knew. I didn't know how to say what I needed to say. All I could think about were all the bad things that had been happening at school last year, every year for that matter. I just couldn't bare to go through that anymore. I was done being fake happy, pretending hateful words didn't hurt, done hiding it from my family. So this video was made for my friends that had moved on to High School who were worried for me, to say to them that I was going to take a stand, and to the haters at my middle school that I'm not going anywhere. I am who I am. I posted the video here and told people were to find it. That was it. My friends were moved by the video and thought I did something important. I was encouraged to upload it to my Facebook page so more people could see it. Maybe it could help someone else going through the same thing. So I linked it Dec. 1st. My Parents saw it for the first time Dec, 2nd. Then..... all this happened. I never expected in a million years that it would have such a wonderful impact on so many people. I am truly humbled and truly thankful for all the love, encouragement and support from people all over the world. It's been incredibly overwhelming. I don't know what to say. Thank you so, so much! Lastly, yes you have seen me happy in a couple short videos replies I posted; I would think that would be a good thing, and yes I do have friends, my High School friends, and I have made friends because when I came out they realized that they had hurt me and that they fealt sorry. The video is real, and true. In the last few months everything eventually came out in the open, I felt a huge weight off my shoulders; I'm happy, I'm excepted for who I am, I'm more confident and feel stronger every day.

Have fun and thanks for adding to the conversation... Agreed with Missneriss, I too felt for this little boy until i saw another video post of him and a girl explaining (very smugly) how everyone at school loves him and he is so popular etc. According to other video posts, it was all a giant hoax. At the end of the day, he is just a confused little boy looking for attention. I also thought, yeah, poor kid. Until a friend of mine linked his youtube channel where he and a bunch of his little mates take the piss out of fat people. Now I just think he's an attention grabber and a fake. Oh, and it looks like his video is a ripoff of another posted earlier this year.
HI	follow lifehacker How to Make the Most of Airplane Wi-Fi and Never Pay Full Price Again Getting online while on a long flight can mean the difference between a fun flight and endless boredom. That said, it can be a little pricey and doesn't always work as well as you'd hope. Here's how you can cut costs and improve your experience with hardly any effort at all. Pay Less for the Same Wi-Fi One of my absolute favorite hacks of all time is getting a discount on airplane Wi-Fi by pretending your laptop is a smartphone. Most web browsers let you set your browser agent, allowing you to let Firefox masquerade as Safari, Internet Explorer, or a mobile phone browser. This is offered for developer testing purposes, but if you simply set your browsing agent to identify as an Android or iPhone you'll automatically get a lower price on your Wi-Fi for that particular flight. Once you've bought your pass, just switch the browsing agent back to normal and you'll be online, free and clear, for less money. (If you don't know how to change your browser's user agent, just watch this video .) We've also previously noted that you can pick up discounted or free Wi-Fi by checking coupon sites like RetailMeNot.com or by looking for rental car and other travel packages that offer free airplane Wi-Fi as an incentive. If you come up dry on either of those options, you can make use of a somewhat more legitimate trick: sharing a monthly pass. If you have a friend or two that flies at least once a month you can buy and share an already discounted monthly pass. So long as you don't use it at the same time you'll be able to share without issue. Better yet, if you're always flying the same airline you might be able to get an airline-specific discount as well. Delta, for example, offers monthly plans for $5 less than the standard any-airline option if you stick with them. Optimize Your Connection GoGo In-flight Internet already compresses and caches images before delivering them to your computer, saving a little download time in the process. The first time you visit a site this can mean slow loading times, but afterwards things speed up a bit. Even so, there's more you can do to further optimize your connection and make your plane-based browsing experience more pleasant. We've previously detailed how to optimize your browser for a slower connection , like when you're tethered to your phone, and many of the same principles apply for airplane Wi-Fi. First of all, you'll want to browse with Opera primarily because of its Opera Turbo feature. It compresses pages just like GoGo generally does, but it tends to be more aggressive and has features like Flash block built in. Alternatively, you can take more extreme measures and set your browsing agent to mobile mode and receive the smaller versions of pages that were designed for slow connections. Either way, you'll want to disable any apps and browser extensions that regularly access the web so your connection speed doesn't suffer due to bandwidth constraints. For example, Dropbox is an easy one to forget and it will slow down your connection quite a bit if you forget to pause syncing. You'll also want to disable automatic updates, increase your browser's cache size, and avoid opening too many tabs at once (and, instead, open just the one you need right at that moment). Basically, anything that might tax your bandwidth behind the scenes is something you're going to want to disable. Building on your big cache, if there are any sites you want to access while you're on the plane, visit them before you fly so you can start caching locally. This will help decrease web page load times a little bit. You may also want to use desktop versions of your favorite sites. For example, a Twitter client won't need to download as much data as the Twitter web site will require. The same goes for desktop email clients over webmail, although you may want to tell your mail client to only check mail manually so it doesn't keep straining your connection. Optimize Your Battery Your connection speed isn't the only thing that can fail you at 30,000 feet. If you're on a long (or long-ish) flight, your laptop's battery is prone to die at some point. Unless you're flying an airline like Virgin America that will provide you with a power outlet, you're going to want to do everything you can to make sure your battery doesn't die out prematurely. You'll want to start out with the more obvious tips: disable anything you don't need, turn off anything that emits light that isn't your display, dim your display to the lowest usable brightness, and block Flash or any other CPU-intensive apps that may start running without your expressed permission. Generally you can eke out a lot of extra battery life with these tips, but you need to make sure you don't have any CPU vampires running around on your computer. They'll suck the battery dry and you may not realize until it's too late. Apps like Dropbox , RescueTime , or anything that regularly requires CPU cycles can add up quickly and cut your battery life down more than a negligible amount. A few other lesser-known tips can also help your laptop maintain a charge a bit longer. Disk access is a battery killer, so you can avoid excessive disk read and write times by defragmenting your disk regularly. You can also help avoid more frequent disk access by adding more RAM to your machine. You're not going to want to do this on an airplane, but if you travel a lot and have been considering a RAM upgrade anyway you now have another minor reason to actually do it. Although disk access can drain the battery, it's better than accessing files from a CD/DVD or external USB device. If there are any files you need while on the plane, copy them to your hard drive before you leave so they don't affect your battery life and therefore the time you can spend online. In the same ways you don't want your internet connection multitasking for the purposes of saving bandwidth for the task at hand, you don't want to multitask for the sake of your battery life. The less you're running and doing in general is better. Consider making a separate account or using a guest account if you're just planning on doing some light browsing. While you won't have access to all your settings, you won't have to worry about tons of apps draining your battery. You can just open your browser and a few other programs you won't to use. In the event your battery does die, be ready with a backup. This doesn't necessarily mean a backup battery, however, as Mac users don't exactly have that option nowadays. Taking a tablet along with you is often a good alternative. Just do anything that requires a laptop while your battery is good and full and switch to the tablet once the laptop's battery runs out. If you signed up for an account (or logged into one you already have) before purchasing your Wi-Fi pass, you should have no trouble transferring it to a new mobile device. (At least, I haven't with GoGo.) While this isn't as ideal as having a never-ending laptop battery, it's a good alternative that's actually possible. Even if all your efforts fail and you end up with crappy Wi-Fi and a slightly lighter wallet, remember the wise words of comedian Louis C.K. : you're flying through the sky in a chair, and that's still pretty amazing. You can follow Adam Dachis, the author of this post, on Twitter , Google+ , and Facebook .  Twitter's the best way to contact him, too.
NA	Not on Facebook? What kind of sad sicko are you? Colorado killer James Holmes, not a fan of Facebook. Photograph: Pool/Getty Images It is a frustration for those who study them that there are not enough murderous psychopaths to help isolate, at all reliably, characteristics specific to the type. Not that this difficulty will ever prevent popular speculation about possible warning signs, now updated for the digital age. For instance, for those old giveaways "kept himself to himself", "never met your eye" or "had unnaturally pointed canines", now read "was not on Facebook", "had never played FarmVille", "unfamiliar with Spotify". In particular, given trends in suspicion, the person with no Facebook presence now finds him or herself in much the same position as, going back a bit, a sweaty person who, having lowered his voice in the pharmacy, requested both chloroform and quicklime. A helpful article in the German newspaper Tagesspiegel has just indicated the risks, for anyone aspiring to mental health, of holding out against Mark Zuckerberg . Noting that neither James Holmes , the murderer of 12 in a Colorado cinema, nor Anders Behring Breivik was a fan of online social networking, the paper quoted a Hanover psychologist, Christoph Mller, on the implications of Facebook resistance. "The internet has become a natural part of life," is a translation of his comments which, circling the Facebook-minded world, have prompted a surge of speculation about what wilful withdrawal from that natural life might mean. For some amateur investigators, Mller's words only confirmed suspicions aroused after the massacre, following internet searches into Holmes's online past or, rather, the outlandish lack of it. On the social media news website Mashable, its editor in chief, Lance Ulanoff, said he couldn't "get over what an online ghost Holmes appears to be". To date, however, the killer is still unidentified on Facebook and a very natural exultation among its professed addicts, following this confirmation of their superior mental health, has been accompanied, perhaps more surprisingly, by reports that Facebook use is now considered so overwhelmingly the norm that employers are more likely than not to consider documented history of online poking, boasting and friending to be a comforting sign of socialisation and professionalism. "It's certainly unusual," a US psychologist told CBS of Holmes's online resistance, in an echo of the ostracism that threatens 12-year-old avoiders in a school where everyone else has -- prematurely -- signed up. Enthusiasts cite a study in which lack of internet use was associated, as much as overuse, with depression. Contrary to the dronings of Facebook resisters, who must now accept that we lie somewhere along the psychopathic continuum, young people in particular need to anticipate the reaction of a future employer who discovers, with incredulity that gives way only to suspicion and distrust, that an otherwise impressive candidate has recorded nothing online regarding their accumulation of friends, social life or holidays in fun destinations. This response to eccentricity, together with a human resource operative's inevitable irritation at finding nothing to report, can only increase as the warnings of Facebook sceptics are drowned by internet pundits proclaiming the backward-looking futility of resistance. Even after Facebook experienced slowing revenue growth, a London technology specialist at the law firm Charles Russell shrugged away doubters with: "Everyone is using Facebook. Facebook has become a utility in our daily lives." For everyone who is anyone, presumably. For some businesses, not being patronised by an unspeakable mass murderer might not look like much of a plus. Equally, for others, being favourited by tyrants, criminals and the intimates of known killers does not seem to have done much damage. The reputation of Christian Louboutin, for instance, has survived the enthusiastic patronage of the designer's friend, Asma al-Assad. Christian Dior seems equally uncontaminated by pictures of the newbie dictator's wife, North Korea's Ri Sol-ju with her 1,000 Dior purse. The absence of two leading psychopaths from Facebook appears, however, to be already translating into an uncovenanted, promotional gift to a company that can hardly avoid association with some of the online world's sadder extremes, still visualised by some of us as millions of little Julian Assanges, each immured in the greenish light of a darkened bedroom and wearing socks unchanged for three decades. Smugly, an army of Facebook users now reports that the smelly sock is on the other foot. Arriving so suddenly after children, in particular, have been routinely counselled to use Facebook infrequently and with enormous caution, thus protecting themselves from -- to name some of the more obvious traps -- obesity, time wasting, stalkers, bullying, invasion of privacy, bitching, hideous embarrassment, isolation, career damage and unwitting complicity in Zuckerberg's latest schemes for monetisation, Facebook's onset of health and normality is going to require some adjustment. But maybe parents will find it quite relaxing, if a child is biddable, to demand that it stops reading or playing and settles down nicely for a few hours of online activity of the sort historically pathologised by Susan Greenfield. Perhaps some of us have been too judgmental in the past about the wholesome exchange of youthful venom and embarrassing pictures. Even scepticism about Facebook's real mission -- the commercial exploitation of private human relationships -- should perhaps be overlooked, now that the place comes with this watertight guarantee: unpopular with two prominent psychopaths. Evidence on the back of the above factoid, that young avoiders could soon, if they are not already, be regarded as eccentric "ghosts", loners or privacy fetishists, is a more troubling victory for Zuckerberg. Already, with site after site only available via Facebook membership, the company's unstoppable colonisation of online information is surely more irksome, for a habitual resister, than the alleged social losses of missed birthdays and the addition of long-dead schoolmates to an impressive friends count. But far from generating significant resistance to a company whose eavesdroppings go beyond anything the News of the World ever dreamed of, this fusion of professional and personal information, along with the relevant advertising, only seems to generate more data-supplying conscripts, in line with Zuckerberg's signature notion of privacy, whereby anyone who prizes it above submission to his social network is not only pretentious, but dodgy. Just what is wrong with reclusives? "Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity," the young moralist informed David Kirkpatrick in The Facebook Effect , a statement yet more uncompromising than Eric Schmidt 's to critics of Google: "If you have something you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it the first place." It's three years since Zuckerberg told Kirkpatrick: "The days of you having a different image for your work friends and co-workers and for the other people you know are probably coming to an end pretty quickly." When people who resist this version of human identity are filed instantly under weird, that end appears to be pretty much here. I'm on Facebook, but that was only because I once registered in order to make contact with one of my relatives whose email address I'd lost. Ever since I registered, I keep getting contacted by people who want to be my friend. I haven't the heart to say no, but when their news comes in I just delete it. Life's too short for social media chitchat. I used to use Facebook. I stopped using Facebook because Zuckerberg doesn't believe in privacy and therefore can't be expected to protect anyone's privacy. A hetero cis white man might not need to keep separate groups of friends, but lesbians and gays may need to keep sexual orientation private, trans folks may need to keep trans status private, and people may need safe spaces to talk about surviving sexual and/or physical violence. There is a lot of homophobia, transphobia, and victim-blaming in America and in much of the rest of the world. This includes violence as well as employment discrimination, housing discrimination, etc., which is completely legal in most of the country. I think I was on Facebook once, or maybe even twice. Only reason I was on was that I had to join in order to get access to somebody else's Facebook posting. Needless to say, I hope, I didn't use my real name, which is George Washington, in case you haven't already guessed. I always thought that the Orwellian snooper-state would be run by the left. Now it's here, it's those freedom-loving upholders of privacy and rugged individualism - the capitalists - who are our Big Brother. I'm a bit dozy about these things -- don't even know how to Tweet. But everywhere I go, I see people absorbed in playing with their little toys: in the call centre where I used to work, the interviewers did somethibng electronic while they robotically conducted interviews. I've seen this action in theatres, cinemas, my evening class, on the benches of the House of Commons. But it's also rife in the street, where I'm forever being mown down by oncoming Facebook-checkers. The other day, as I crossed the high street in my small town at a zebra crossing, I gave two waves of thanks to the driver of the car that had stopped: one for me, and one for the woman walking alongside me, who hadn't looked up from her tiny screen. Oh, and my favourite cartoon (in Prospect magazine) was of a woman in period costume walking towards a railway line, along which a steam train is advancing. She's keying in: "Vronsky and I have split up, and I don't know what I'll do now..." I thought Facebook and sites like it were losing members .I joined it last year and I never use it other than to wish relatives happy birthday or suchlike it saves on cards. I find it incredibly boring and pointless maybe I'm a latent psychopath who knows. yup some of like a little bit of data being kept out of the hands of the secret service, tax, benefits, and police hands. not so much because we are criminal, more because we like a sense of privacy. Iv'e started a policy of charging for the use of my data! Paulrudolph: "I do not want to be able to be contacted by anyone from my past,if i did i would have kept in contact with them." So you just ignore those people's requests and hey presto, you won't be contacted by them - it's hardly rocket science. But it IS nice being contacted by people from your present especially when, like me, you've emigrated to the other side of the world and want to keep up with news and photos from good friends and family, or perhaps getting involved in a debate with several mates in different time zones simultaneously. Email just doesn't cut it. I left Facebook too. Love it on CiF though. Plenty of likeminded and not-so-likeminded people on here willing to talk to each other about stuff that matters, rather than tell each other what they had for breakfast and link to videos of cats. It's three years since Zuckerberg told Kirkpatrick: "The days of you having a different image for your work friends and co-workers and for the other people you know are probably coming to an end pretty quickly." When people who resist this version of human identity are filed instantly under weird, that end appears to be pretty much here. Only if you buy into such high level cack. Facebook undermines basic human instinct on not accepting sweets off strangers, it's Facebook that is weird, not those who resist it. Facebook does something far more insidious than 'not respecting' privacy; it extends surveillance beyond political and commercial activity into the social and personal - and actively cultivates complicity in this. It is a measure of its totalitarian omnipresence that this article is actually a huge relief to me, as are many of the comments above; there are others yet to be body-snatched! The problem is how, in the absence of a facebook group, resistance can be organised.... I'm off to write a letter for the hell of it. So when do these oh so open facebookers start telling us the real detail, how about including details of all their negative sides together with full details of their medical history, sex lives and all the lies they may have told others. But most wont so what are these facebookers hiding? half the picture can be worse than no picture in the same way that half truths can be worse than bare faced lies. He also had a YouTube account and used it to post a video just before his attack. He also had a Twitter account although he only posted one tweet. After the attack a Norwegian right-wing nationalist compiled and posted all the comments Breivik made on their website and the BBC report refers to a different far-right forum. He may not have been a long-term and heavy user of Facebook but, to paraphrase an often-used reminder, other social networking websites are available. It always astonishes me how many people who don't use Facebook and claim not to know anything about it (or claim to know that everyone on it is sad and an attention-seeker) race to display their ignorance on threads like this. Is it perhaps to display that you're even more ignorant of some of the basics of social networking than Barbara Ellen? Facebook is social networking for the middle aged, mid-life crises victim desperately trying to convince others of their youthfulness. It's the website of parents. Young people don't want to social network with their parents. Facebook is tired old crap, a naff little, embarrassing pop culture craze of years ago like Nu Metal or "Girl Power". Something in a few years kids will be told by their mothers to ask their dad about. Taking into account that some 83 million face book accounts are false representation in terms of identity, and actual facts of the so called profiles, where there is no collaboration. One would think that the opposite is true. People in general have a tendency to hype up their self image of good, credentials, and hide character pitfalls/ perversities. Would Mitt Romney add to his that he a offshore tax cheat and his professional expertise is tax shelter havens. Or Tony Blair / Bill Clinton the AR hick being a diplomatic con man, offering advice as to how to make deals, collect obscene fee , and use their hideous diplomatic experience to double talk, be evasive, how to lie through there teeth , twist the truth to justify their actions. It always astonishes me how many people who don't use Facebook and claim not to know anything about it (or claim to know that everyone on it is sad and an attention-seeker) race to display their ignorance on threads like this. Agreed. If you're not on Facebook fine, I'm not either, but no need for the holier-than-thou bullshit. No-one's impressed. Facebook use is now considered so overwhelmingly the norm that employers are more likely than not to consider documented history of online poking, boasting and friending to be a comforting sign of socialisation and professionalism. It is the norm. If you don't have Facebook, and an employer asks you why, then you should be able to answer that honestly. A long while ago, for a volunteering position in an organization that was very socially networked, they asked me why I didn't have Facebook. I told them honestly that I've been a victim in the past to a significant number of criminals, most of whom have either been released or were never jailed and that I'm very restrictive of having my contact information/list of friends/etc so easily available on the internet. They understood, and I got the position. Employers aren't stupid or unreasonable. Facebook isn't the only form of social networking. Even if you don't have Facebook, you can direct your prospective employers to other accounts (such as the one you're on right now on the Guardian?). But other than reasonable cases, it's most likely true that if you're not on some sort of social networking, you're not on there for a reason (and it''s most likely not about "privacy"). Just like with non-internet life, people who avoid networking or sociality are probably either socially deficient or have something to hide. (But whatever someone has to hide doesn't necessarily need to be their own fault). I do have a FB account - signed up to see some photographs posted by an old school friend. I have made comments on real life friend postings about five times; had three conversations with two people from nearly thirty years ago who must have searched for my maiden name (dammit: that is why I didn't use my married name in the first place). I have never posted, thinking that the number of people who might be interested in what I did last night or what I had for breakfast might be in minus numbers. On this subject, I really resent the "share" on Amazon: does anyone really desperately want to know that I just bought a book or a cheese grater? I do ignore it, but it is very irritating. The only "friends" I have on FB are my real-life ones. Anyone who has twenty-five squillion friends and brags about it is seriously deluded. Anyway, I must be a psychopath because I don't actually use my account. "Social media" can undoubtedly be a good thing for families and friends separated by geography, but some of the rest of us simply cannot be bothered. "I have enough to do in life. I am beavering away as hard as I can for most of my waking hours and the idea that I have to keep telling people what I am doing and catching up with what they are doing is absurd." Joined Facebook, use it for pointlessly trying to inject reason and logic onto the occasional internet debate, chuckle at old schoolchums who've gone fat and bald, and prevent my partner getting romantic messages from single African/Asian men on the site of which there is an abundance all with poor English and a visa in their hearts. Nobody takes the site seriously and it'll go the way MySpace did within a few years when they try and make the site pay. But other than reasonable cases, it's most likely true that if you're not on some sort of social networking, you're not on there for a reason (and it''s most likely not about "privacy"). It's a means of communication. E-mail does the job without you having to give all your information to a megacorporation so they can sell it to advertisers. That's a "privacy" issue, and it does matter. Talking, face-to-face or over a telephone, is also quite effective. (I am generally too lazy to write letters though.) And any employer that demands a social networking history from me can get to fuck. A professional networking history would be another matter, but that generally takes place in less public forums anyway. I am not a forensic psychiatrist but James Holmes looks mental ill in every photograph I see of him. Suicidally depressive and acting on mental illness is not psychopathology. Take away the USA's love of automatic weapons and his crime is that he his mentally ill and got no help. Did he have insurance? I cancelled FB years ago. I recently logged back and there was my life froze four years back. It was creepy but at least now I can say "I am not a psychopath because my FB account is active!" That is a huge relief. It has been bothering a lot :-) My grandmother wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a Facebook user and a CiF user. She'd say "If you spend anymore time sitting so close to that thing your eyes will go square, now get outside, it's a lovely day!" The grease of chips inside my straggly beard Is reaching overload And nobody's gonna Like me today She wants to Poke them and stay at home And daddy doesn't understand it He's never said she's worth more than bits And he can see no reasons 'Cos there are no reasons What reason do you need to be show-ow-ow-ow-own?

The absurdly over valued stock floatation will see facebook under more and more pressure to make money and it will become an ever more intrusive tool of market researchers - which will accelerate its journey into the social media wasteland alongisde the likes myspace and friends reunited
OP	Read the latest news from Annette Sym Spring is in the air Annette Sym - Monday, September 03, 2012 Yes Spring is in the air, we can now start thinking about salads, exercise and swimming. Are you ready to spring into Spring? During winter most tend to hibernate, for example jumping out of bed at 6am when it is dark and cold can stop even the most health conscious person and walking late afternoon means darkness at 5.30pm. Longer daylight hours and warmer weather lifts the spirit, so now is the perfect time to get your health and exercise routines back into full swing. Let's get ready for summer, here are some tips: 1. Try on your favourite summer outfit from last year and see how it fits now. If it is a bit snug or the buttons don't do up then take this as a sign that you need to shed a few kilos before summer kicks in. Another good idea is to put on your swimsuit and take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror. Do you like what you see? If not then do something about it, now! 2. Dust off the barbie and get back to cooking your meat on the grill and serve with interesting salads. Making tasty sauces to pour over steak will give meat a lift and make it much more tempting. Barbequing your meat allows the fats to escape through the grill, a great way to reduce the fat count. If you find it is still too cool for salads then saut some vegetables on the flat side of the barbeque with some garlic and spices. 3. Spring means crisp apples, tasty oranges, mandarins and strawberries are at their best. Vegetables such as artichokes, snow peas, bok choy, asparagus and avocados are in season and inexpensive. Why not make up some homemade soups using spring vegetables before the hot weather arrives. 4. Spring means it's time to stop having the heavy stodgy winter foods. Spring means lighter healthier meals, more fresh fruit and a time to get back outside and exercise. This is such a beautiful time of the year so enjoy what spring has to offer and get healthy at the same time. 5. Instead of doing a spring clean at home do a spring clean of your eating habits. Throw out any bad habits that have caused you problems over winter and look for new ways to shed those unwanted kilos. Your attitude determines your actions, so act now and reap the rewards.
NA	Ian Kinnaird, 72, has a genetic marker inherited from his mother that traces his ancestry to an African lineage that has not been found before in Western Europe. Researchers from Britain's DNA, who carried out the tests, said the result meant that in genetic terms he was a "thoroughbred", and could be described as the "grandson of Eve, or the grandfather of everyone in Britain". They were so surprised by the results that they phoned Mr Kinnaird, a widower who lives in the far north of Scotland, to break the news to him. They told him his mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), passed through the female line, was 30,000 years old and only two genetic mutations removed from the first woman, while most men have a genome with around 200 mutations since the earliest humans. Alistair Moffat, the historian and rector of St Andrews University, who was involved in setting up the DNA project, said: "It is an astonishing result and means he could have been in the 'Garden of Eden'. "It is further proof that even white Anglo-Saxon Protestants are descended from a black Eve." The project has now tested 2,000 people across the United Kingdom and most have markers that trace their ancestry back up to 3,500 years, These defined them as descendants of various groups including the earliest Britons, the Ancient Irish, Vikings, hunter gatherers and cave painters. The project aims to map Britain's "family tree" and previously found that the actor Tom Conti shared an ancestor with Napoleon Bonaparte. Mr Kinnaird, of Halkirk, Caithness, who taught at the North Highland College in Thurso, and was a tutor for the Open University, said he was interested in history but had no particular expectations when he paid 200 for the test. It also showed his "fatherline" is Scandinavian and he carries a YDNA marker which is found in a quarter of Norwegian men. He said: "I have led an unremarkable life until now but my computer has been red hot since I was told. This is a real gobsmacker. I seem to carry a gene from west Africa that arrived through the slave trade. "I have been researching the links between the slave trade and Liverpool, the area where the female side of my family came from. Africa was part of my geography degree at Hull University in 1959, but I couldn't have imagined anything like this." Mr Kinnaird's L1B1 genetic marker will also be carried by his sister Jean, 65, a retired teacher who taught in Wigan, and the daughter she had at the age of 17 who was given up for adoption. Mr Moffat, who set up Britain's DNA with James Wilson, a geneticist from Edinburgh University, said the unassuming lecturer was a "remarkable" individual. He added: "This lineage appears in Africa, in Senegal, but has never been seen in north-west Europe. It is likely to have reached Britain through the arrival of slaves in Liverpool. "A woman who might be called Eve and a man who might be called Adam really existed. "Eve, the mother of all of us, lived around 190,000 years ago just as homo sapiens were evolving. Other women lived at the same time but only Eve's mtDNA survived. "Adam also lived in central Africa, perhaps only 140,000 years ago. Only his YDNA survived to father all of the male lineages on earth. "Mr Kinnaird cannot pass on his mtDNA, but his sister could and she had a daughter who will carry the lineage." The tests by Britain's DNA suggest 32 per cent of British men are descended from the Pretani, or original Britons, more than 12 per cent have Germanic ancestry, 11 per cent are hunter gatherers and more than seven per cent are Ancient Irish.
OP	Do me a favor. Go to your local Patch website and type "DUI" in the search field. Astonishing isn't it? But the irony is, because it's the most often reported story, we don't pay much attention until someone with a relatively high profile gets nabbed. Somehow, we've gotten to the point were the inevitability of drunken driving has become a given. And I'm just as guilty as everyone else. It took the recent Patch news story on the Batavia girls high school softball coach who resigned as a result of a DUI charge to make me seriously start thinking about this persistent problem. It brought back one my frequent conversations with former Kane County State's Attorney John Barsanti, who made a very interesting point about our cultural mindset. He said, while most of us are quick to say things like, "It's illegal to drink and drive," it really isn't. The truth is, you're well within your rights to have a few beers at a bar or enjoy a bottle of wine at a restaurant as long as you don't cross that magic .08 blood alcohol level line. Barsanti cogently noted, "The real problem is there's a certain amount of drinking and driving people in this country are willing to tolerate. That's the difference between the U.S. and Europe." So let's take a closer look at exactly what .08 means. Using my 180-pound frame as a point of reference, I would have to consume six 12-ounce beers, five 5-ounce glasses of wine, or five mixed drinks in a two-hour period on an empty stomach before I'd hit the legal limit. Maybe I'm just a lightweight, but if I drank five Bloody Marys in two hours, I'd probably pass out. I'd certainly be in no condition to drive. And frankly, I wouldn't want to get behind the wheel of a car after imbibing just half of the amounts I described. And science backs me up. For example, at the .05 BAC level, drivers start to suffer from lowered alertness as well as minor muscle control loss which includes the ability to quickly focus their eyes. A 20- to 29-year-old with a BAC of .05 is 20 times more likely to be involved in a fatal car crash. Even at the .02 level, most drivers demonstrate a loss of judgment, a decline in visual function, and their multi-tasking capacity heads right out the window. So Barsanti (now a judge) was dead on. Though we consistently make noise about getting tough on drunk drivers, it's difficult to do that when our basic premise is you can go ahead and drive impaired -- but only up to a point! So what's our reaction to all this? Not much! While the police do their best to get these inebriated folks off the road, because the courts generally proceed as if driving is a right and not a privilege, it takes multiple DUIs before we'll take someone's license. The DuPage and Kane County state's attorneys are so frustrated by chronic DUI offenders who know how to play the aforementioned system, they've resorted to "No Refusal Weekends," where motorists are randomly stopped at pre-announced check points. First, any chronic drunken driver worth his margarita salt pays attention to the papers and, armed with the knowledge of exactly where the cops will be, avoids them. And second, no matter what any judge tells you, it's patently unconstitutional to pull someone over without probable cause. Despite some politicians best efforts, we're still innocent until proven guilty. Then MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Drivers) chimes in and, though their hearts are in the right place, their draconian breathlock focus on first-time offenders only makes matters worse when the repeat offender that's the real problem. Ironically, Barsanti also told me that, when folks do complain about No Refusal Weekends, they never cite the Constitution. They claim the state's attorney is impinging up on their "right" to have a few cocktails with dinner. So how do we change this prevailing mindset? Personally, I believe the key to that shift lies in Barsanti's brief allusion to European DUI laws. In Sweden, if you blow a .02 that will get you a DUI. That means just one beer on an empty stomach and you're facing a fine that amounts to 10 percent of your annual income as well as a one-year license suspension. If your BAC level is determined to be .10, it's a minimum of six months in jail at hard labor, even for your first offense. Your license isn't suspended -- it's permanently revoked. Get caught a second time, and you're off to the pokey for two years. And the statutes are very similar throughout the EEU. Word to the wise! If you ever avail yourself of a European rental car, the local gendarmes specifically target those vehicles because they know most Americans have no clue about these DUI laws. The bottom line is, though these statutes seem unduly harsh, they work, because the fact that, drinking any amount and driving is illegal, has been indelibly imprinted upon the average European's mind. Now, before you say this shift would doom restaurants and bars to extinction, please remember that we're talking about a culture that allows their children to have a glass of wine with dinner. But as a Swedish friend told me, there's always a designated driver who doesn't touch a drop. "They may have drunks sleeping in the parks in Stockholm," she said, "but no one drinks and drives in Sweden." So with such an obvious solution staring us straight in the face, in light of that insistent Patch DUI coverage, I keep wondering when we're going to start taking this problem seriously. I say, let's follow the European example and make it illegal to drink and drive. Well then, you're going to have to take out vehicle radios, ban any cell phones from vehicles, and make all vehicles no-talking zones because distracted drivers are the #1 cause of MVCs. Then, you'll have to put governers in all vehicles tied to a government-approved map of speed limits, because speeding (including loss of control) is #2. Drunk driving is #3. The point is, there are laws for all of the above, they have equal likelihood to involve other drivers / serious injury / death, and they all involve humans making bad choices. You gonna lock up people who text and drive for six months since that person is more likely to cause an accident as a drunk? @Patrick: Personally, I agree with the cell phone ban, because studies have shown that talking on the phone takes your attention away from driving, even if you use a hands-free device--your mind is figuratively somewhere else. Drivers should only use a cell phone in a moving vehicle in an emergency. Listening to the radio or talking to a passenger don't have the same level of distraction (talk radio may be worse than music, in terms of emotional involvement). A passenger has an inherent interest in paying attention to their surroundings and how the driver is performing, after all! Of the top 3 reasons you cite, speeding is the easiest to patrol, as the speed of the vehicle can be ascertained without stopping it or violating anyone's "rights", so probable cause is not required. I think that we have let speeding get out of hand in the U.S. Although many claim that speed limits are set unrealistically low as a revenue-generating scheme by local governments, if that were the real case, they're doing a lousy job of collecting "easy money"! I think people are just basically ignorant, selfish, AND not paying attention (those darn cell phones!). Speed limits are set for the "common good", based on logical factors like reaction time, # of entrances and businesses along the road, type of area (residential, school, commercial), keeping traffic moving at the same rate, and other reasonable factors. I agree, ban cell phones all together! Also, how about the pizza place owner in Downers Grove that was arrested for DUI this year? He has liquor licenses in 2 establishments, but isn't responsible himself! I think we should hold people accountable. He wants to profit from selling alcohol, then learn how to control it and use it properly for himself!!!! I know a lot of companies that require their salesmen with company cars to not get tickets or DUIs, or they lose their car privelages and maybe their job! Let's do the same here! I was once behind a car on Route 83 that was drifting from side to side in its lane, and kept speeding up and slowing down. The driver appeared to be in a very animated conversation with the passenger, looking at the passenger and shaking a finger. Clearly, the conversation was so distracting that the driver couldn't drive straight and at a constant speed. As to speed limits, sometimes I can't figure out what was the thinking for the speed limit. I've been on roads in the Chicago are that are one speed, only to see a 10 mph decrease upon entering the next suburb, with no significant changes in the area. I think suburbs will set a speed too low, just to get revenue from speeders. By the same token, I was recently in Houston, where freeways in the urban and suburban areas are 65mph. Considering that traffic volumes are similar to the expressways and tollways in Chicago, that speed limit is too high. The .08 is the problem. Nobody knows when you cross that magic number. Put a breath tester in every establishment that serves alcohol. Let the patron test themselve when they leave. If they are over .08 and still start their car, they deserve a DUI. Jeff, I think you have a good point. Don't they say "buzzed driving is drunk driving?" I don't know what .08 looks like on me, but I know I don't feel comfortable driving after even one drink. Living in the suburbs makes it hard because people always drive. Public transportation isn't as accessible and most people won't walk somewhere unless the destination is under a mile. I wish there was an easy solution to this problem, but I think it is multifaceted. I like the idea of harsher penalties though. The solution for DUI is really quite simple - adopt the policy of China - six months penal incarceration for the first offense. Years ago, either Bolivia or Ecuador had the ultimate penalty - death for the first offense. The problem with DUI is that the judiciary does not really take the offense very seriously. Some judges actually think it a joke. Others bend over backwards to accomodate the drunk driver, worrying more about the effect of losing his license on his family members rather than the public being subjected to someone behind the wheel of a two ton missile. And what about that scandal our local press disclosed several weeks ago on repeated offenders still be given "supervision" rather than a more severe penalty. As for the cell phone problem - simply ban their use AT ANY TIME whenever a vehicle is in motion - PERIOD! There is nothing so important that a person has to gab on a cell phone while driving. I am sorry but harsher penalties on drunken driving aren't the answer. It may make some people feel better but hasrher penalties on drugs hasn't helped anything. Furthermore the accidents we see arent a result of people under .08. If people are driving poorly (outside an setablished law - pull them over and take appropriate action. To do what he local police in St Charles do is right on the edge of a polic state. Their rudness to the citizens is apparent. Sit in an open air bar or walk the streets at night. The are particularly rude to our young people. 6 12 ounce beers and 25 ounces of wine in a 2 hour period to hit that limit? Wrong. You'd be way way over .08 if you consumed that amount in a 2 hour period. Why do you do your homework before you post on something you know nothing about. Good grief. For all you 'punish harder' folks, I look forward to the day when your moderate behavior is on the wrong end of someone's extremist crusade. Please don't protest the harsh treatment you perceive or call on such outdated concepts as 'constitutional rights'...noone will listen to your reason, noone will use judgement. You'll hear about 'studies that show' and 'cops who just know'. And you'll be just as punished. In other words, this really isn't shouldn't be about drinking and driving at all. This is about driving impaired. It doesn't matter what impairs you. Abolish drunk driving laws and place the emphasis on identifying and dealing with reckless driving. That's a good point. Impaired judgement and reactions are what kill people on the road. Whether that means being drunk, texting, talking to a passenger or just being 90 years old. Throwing down a zero tolerance limit for one specific form of impairment is a 'feel good' measure that politicians can feel comfortable rallying around (after all, who in their right mind is in favor of drunk driving?) But it's not going to make you any safer on the road. Heck, for my money - permanently revoke the license of the middle aged columnist who almost ran down the bicyclist in the crosswalk. Where is your source support for the statement that at 0.02 "most drivers demonstrate a loss of judgment, a decline in visual function, and their multi-tasking capacity heads right out the window." Perhaps you should look up Dubowski's Acute Stages of Intoxication, the definitive word on these things. What we need to do is realize that reaching a certain age level doesn't make you a responsible drinker. Alcohol consumption should be more like driving an earned privilage not a right. Why not license drinkers as well as drivers. This would give law enforcement another tool by allowing them to take away from an individual that abuses alcohol the ability to purchase it. All licenses like roofing, plumbing and driving have a requirement to carry proper insurance. Those that prove themselves high risk would pay a higher price and may find themselves uninsurable and unable to get a drinkers license. So as well as 50 hours behind the wheel with your teenager you might find yourself doing 50 hours of drinking at the ball park with him before he is able to graduate from learners permit to full fledged licensed drinker. First of all , how did this article get published with wrong information regarding the law? If you blow below .08 that's still a DUI. You get two tickets when you get arrested for drunk driving. One for driving under the influence and ANOTHER if you are over .08. This is a direct quote from the Rules of Road Illinois handbook page 46. " ...However, you can be convicted of Driving Under the Influence (DUI) if your BAC is less than .08 percent and your driving ability is impaired." Drunk Driving is a SOCIETY problem. When people go out and have drinks instead of telling a friend, "give me your keys I'll call a cab" , they ask " Are you okay to drive?" That is the problem. Somehow in this culture drinking and driving is a joke. I can't tell you how many times I've heard someone my age (mid twenties) laugh about times they've driven drunk. Look around, and you will notice how embedded drinking and driving is in society. Go to a sporting event, a bar, a restaurant and watch how many people drink alcohol then get behind the wheel. I can't tell you how many times I've been offered a drink even after saying "no, I'm driving" the reply is always , "Just have one".....Why does anyone NEED to drink anyways?! If we want to start to mirror the punishment that Europe has, perhaps we should also take a look at the drinking ages of those European Countries too. Something could be said fo their methods. We need to be harder on those that are wreckless when they drink but we also need to teach our young better ways about alcohol. Having the age at 21 needs to be rethought. Have all the reports of DUI from much olders drivers maks one think that we are doing something wrong. Every time someone is killed by cell phone or texting distraction, I place the blame squarely at people like the author - Jeff Ward, YOU are to blame for those deaths. Why? because of people like him, lawmakers are endlessly one upping each other incrementally increasing the penalties for DUI while failing to make any laws about cell phone/texting/iPhone use AT ALL. Driving in traffic, you see 1/2 of all drivers glued to these things In 1980, MADD corrected an imballance of perception about alcohol and traffic safety. But today, it and zeolots like Jeff Ward CREATE an imballance of perception in alcohol vs device distraction, which causes people to DIE agree with Jeff on this one, harsher penalties, loss of license, lose car or $10000 automatic fine first offense, find a way where lawyers can't get clients off, 2nd offense automatic time in jail and higher fine, also lose car driving in no matter who owns it., make it unbearable to get caught, have police follow repeat offenders near their house and spot check them
OP	FEATURE: The 10 billion profit opportunity Our latest research reveals that businesses spend, on average, two-thirds of their revenue on non-labour costs -- 68.3% in 2011. This far outstrips their collective labour costs, which averaged just 12.9% of their revenue. Yet headcount reduction is traditionally seen as the best way to tackle cost. This raises a number of questions: Are businesses ensuring that their non-labour cost base is being effectively managed? Proxima Blog Why labor isn't working (as a way of boosting struggling earnings) Apple is the world's largest company -- and happily, for those who care about such things, it's both an innovator and a manufacturer. A symbol, if you like, for progressive capitalism in the 21st century: neither pure-play service business nor industrial-age dinosaur. Apple doesn't just get a pretty number in a ranking. With all of its manufacturing outsourced -- like tens of thousands of other companies -- it gets flexibility, speed and low costs. The red tape burden is minimized. And the people it does hold onto? They're the high-value ones. They create (and, probably in hundreds of cases, defend) the intellectual property that makes it a successful business. So what's the catch? Well, actually there are two. First, successfully executing this strategy demands real discipline. The supply chain is complicated and your reliance on your key suppliers absolute. If that reliance turns into blind dependence, you can be storing up trouble. If you get complacent either your competitors or suppliers can eat you up. Second, these kinds of businesses are generally very lean. That's good. But it means if things don't go so well -- you have a run of poorly-performing products, the market shifts against you or a competitor ups their game -- your options are limited. Agile new competitor emerges? Target managers to boost productivity and make redundancies. Cutting the payroll was a fast and reliable way of protecting the bottom line and sending a message to the markets. But now? Those same cuts will often be jeopardizing muscle, not fat. Apple is riding high, but if it came under earnings pressure sometime in the future(?) those direct employees -- the innovators, the designers, the Apple Store Geniuses -- are its route out of trouble, not the source of a few million in lower costs. Many companies have committed to that kind of long-term strategy. So they need long-term, sustainable solutions when they're looking to improve earnings. Labor should be lean -- and at just 12% of annual revenues (that's an average across the FTSE 350) they are. So the future of enhanced earnings has to mean efficiency elsewhere. That can be tough. Supply chains are complex -- and opportunities for optimizing them look limited to those who were instrumental in their design. But when you know where to look, there are always openings. Back in 1987, American Airlines saved $40,000 a year by taking one olive out of its first class salad. That wasn't a random saving. Someone had noticed what no-one in the procurement or catering functions had: there were lots of olives in the waste being carried off the aircraft. The passengers weren't even eating them. That holistic, long-term view of the supply chain is the best way for today's businesses to make sustainable improvements to earnings. Cutting headcount -- with that relatively small share of revenue taken by labor -- might give you a tiny nudge next quarter. But the long-term consequences could be dire. Our latest research reveals that businesses spend, on average, two-thirds of their revenue on non-labor costs -- 68.3% in 2011. This far outstrips their collective labor costs, which averaged just 12.9% of their revenue. Yet headcount reduction is traditionally seen as the best way to tackle cost. This raises a number of questions: Are businesses ensuring that their non-labor cost base is being effectively managed? I like the argument. Instead of cutting payroll focus should be on improving efficiency, Waste management, Piling up inventory to name a few. Posted @ Thursday, October 18, 2012 5:57 AM by BIPLAB KUMAR MOHANTY As the author noted, its only effective for short-term earnings management. in fact, when you add in the severance pay, the actual cost reduction has a lag of 9-12 months depending on the level and compensation of sacked HC.

I think H and H both miss the point on the best teacher question...you dont need to actually talk to the best teacher..you just want to know if the school knows which teachers are better than others and I assume you would want to know how the school is helping the teachers that arent quite as good... I remember walking by Auckland Girls Grammar a few years ago. One part of the playground was full of white students, another part was full of brown students. I guess they get a "not complete" for question one. Ham, you wont get this, it involves grown up concepts that your glib one liners cannot penetrate. Its about a school not being afraid to identify success in its teachers, and allow others to understand that and model the same techniques. So that kids can grow as well as teachers. As a people manager and leader, Im constantly pushing, guiding, coaching and looking to expand and test my leaders, and so grow them and my organisation. And part of that is understanding who my stars are, and getting them to seed a little of that around them. If you cant understand a concept as simple as that, and I doubt you can, then your grey "were all the same, yay" world is the best place for you. You're missing the point there Hambrain A principal identfying the best teacher shows that the principal recognises that not all teachers are the same and that they should at least try to recognise the best ones. Number 3, a favourite of the left. It is part of the wests culture and success that the success of the few is celebrated and it should be celebrated. Life is full of winners and losers and we should all strive to win, not cotton pad our children and pretend that we are all equal The girls at Auckland Girls' Grammar segregate themselves into Asian, Pakeha and Pacific, despite some effort by teachers to separate them. My daughter, who went there, says the cultural, attitudional and intellectual differences mean they generally feel more comfortable with their own. Hattie says &gt; 4. Ask to meet the best teacher. If they tell you they're all good, they're not thinking clearly. Teachers are like ordinary people and have different skills and talents. They are musical, sporty, empathetic, extroverts, introverts, good with reluctant learners, good at accelerating achievers, interested in science, interested in maths. If you ask to meet the "best" teacher and you don't say what your criteria are then it's no suprise if you get a simplistic answer. What I especially noted in the weekend paper was the reports from various interest groups. Several principals said that National Standards didn't change how they operated much because they already talked among themselves as a teaching group, and identified children who were struggling and directed resources at them. One principal already had 'specialist teachers' for both the bottom 10% of students (who struggled most) and the top 10% of students (who weren't being challanged enough). We had parents who were relieved that they could finally see how their kids were doing. Funniest was the group who complained that the assessment of where children where at was open to interpretation and there wasn't any moderation. Moderation was in the original plan but was dropped after an outcry from teacher unions. Then we had the head of the Principals Union. Negative, whiney, hand-wringing, intransigent... What an awful person One of the best indicators I know is to meet with the principal just on lunch time and ask him to take you on a tour of the school. How the kids interact with him and how he repsonds is an excellent guide. Also -- look at the classroom walls at the art and other works on display -- The walls should be full to overflowing -- A good inidcator of kids pride in their work Im prepared to buy you one to North Korea Ham, mainstreet utopia for you, right? And not even one way, return. If you can get out, you can come back and tell us how truly fucking awesome the workers paradise really is. Whaleoil (684) Says: September 24th, 2012 at 8:06 am The best teacher is the one who isn't a member of the nzei. Yes and is compliant and accepting of government policy without question. But seriously Hattie makes some very good points. I have to say I have been very happy with the standard of education our kids have received and the teachers they have had. I like the concept of National Standards, I am pissed off that what we have is not properly moderated, I have a good degree of scepticism about the results of those schools that are markedly out of line with the rest. Moderation would address this. Someone said Moderation was in the original plan but was dropped after an outcry from teacher unions. I can understand the teacher's union not being in support of it if it is unfunded. It's takes huge organisation to ship kids work around the country to get other people to grade it. And that organisation comes at a cost as well as the cost of shipping. See if the school has a good number of men teachers. see if they have a copy of the Rules of Rugby Football at the doorway. If you are Polynesian insist your child is taught by a Polynesian. If you are European insist your child is taught by a European male-a rarity. Check that the Headmistress/master doesn't have a coloured badge already on their chests. RRM, completely agree. Its something we and our friends comment on from time to time. Our house monkeys go to a full primary, decile 10 in New Plymouth. Kids there are almost all polite in that same way. It comes down largely to what happens at home -- you dont learn that at school, its reinforced there. We read to all ours from very early on. My wife and I are both voracious readers, and our kids are the same -- all with reading ages well in advance of their years. If youve not done it by the time they are 5, battle lost. If you have, well done, youve set them up for life. Yes, some very interesting observations from Hattie. The elephant in the room is that he doesn't mention National Standards. At all. But according to the Right, National Standards are EVERYTHING. Shows how inept the Right is when it comes to education. Ten reasons people ! I was always against decimalisation because it made "division" easier for the masses. And the Dewey system,once they learnt how to read I thought if we could just hide the relevant books in the library they'd never find them anyway. This question should be put to Beck Eleven. You'd also run if: the next relieving teacher is Dover Samuels. Meanwhile, our illustrious leader John Key says that "Ignorance takes us nowhere" when it comes to National Standards. This is the same person who refused to read the police report into the John Banks saga. Has New Zealand ever seen a more pig-ignorant Prime Minister? Maybe Muldoon but maybe I'm being unfair to the rotund one. John Key: "We're saying that 30 per cent of young New Zealanders are not attaining the level that we would want them to attain in terms of reading, writing and maths." Hmmm not sure where he plucked the figure of 30% from -- and I don't expect him to tell us -- but the point he conveniently misses is that a proportion of NZers are not doing well...under a National Government. It's as if this government bears absolutely no responsibility for this state of affairs. You raise a really good point woss. Because, and lets be blunt, under labour the 30% was 0% wasn't it -- labours education policy saw all those leaving school going on to get first class degrees at universities around the world. Don't forget pixies and rainbows too. Or, maybe this infantile attempt at smearing National demonstrates where the education system is really lacking -- allowing dullards like you the vote and probably the right to drive as well. Under labour we had no idea what education standards were being met as a country, no way of seeing how our kids were doing comparatively, and therefore no means of bringing about positive change -- measure what you treasure. Now we have the start of a meaningful measurement process, a process that will allow for trend analysis over time, not hysteria. My only hope is that some teacher leaders grow up and engage in a meaningful way -- for the sake of the kids. Having teacher leaders talk about ignoring the law sends a great message to kids. But then you ignore laws all the time that you dont agree with dont you wossy?
NA IN	Science News ScienceDaily (June 7, 2012) ? Children living in urban centers have a much higher prevalence of food allergies than those living in rural areas, according to a new study, which is the first to map children's food allergies by geographical location in the United States. In particular, kids in big cities are more than twice as likely to have peanut and shellfish allergies compared to rural communities. The study will be published in the July issue of Clinical Pediatrics . "We have found for the first time that higher population density corresponds with a greater likelihood of food allergies in children," said lead author Ruchi Gupta, M.D., an assistant professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a physician at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago (formerly Children's Memorial). "This shows that environment has an impact on developing food allergies. Similar trends have been seen for related conditions like asthma. The big question is -- what in the environment is triggering them? A better understanding of environmental factors will help us with prevention efforts." Gupta, also a researcher at the Institute for Healthcare Studies at the Feinberg School, said some of her future research will focus on trying to identify the environmental causes. The study included 38,465 children, 18 years and under, who comprised a representative sample of U.S. households. Their food allergies were mapped by ZIP code. Here are the key findings of the study: In urban centers, 9.8 percent of children have food allergies, compared to 6.2 percent in rural communities. Peanut allergies are twice as prevalent in urban centers as in rural communities, with 2.8 percent of children having the allergy in urban centers compared to 1.3 percent in rural communities. Shellfish allergies are more than double the prevalence in urban versus rural areas; 2.4 percent of children have shellfish allergies in urban centers compared to 0.8 percent in rural communities. Food allergies are equally severe regardless of where a child lives, the study found. Nearly 40 percent of food-allergic children in the study had already experienced a severe, life-threatening reaction to food. The states with the highest overall prevalence of food allergies are Nevada, Florida, Georgia, Alaska, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and the District of Columbia. Food allergy is a serious and growing health problem. An estimated 5.9 million children under age 18, or one out of every 13 children, now have a potentially life-threatening food allergy, according to 2011 research by Gupta. A severe allergic reaction that can lead to death includes a drop in blood pressure, trouble breathing and swelling of the throat. A food-allergic reaction sends an American to the emergency room every three minutes, according to a March 2011 study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology . Past research has shown an increased prevalence of asthma, eczema, allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis in urban areas versus rural ones. One hypothesis is that exposure early in life to certain bacteria associated with rural living may protect against hereditary hypersensitivity to certain allergens. Or, many pollutants encountered in urban areas may trigger the development of these allergies. The Food Allergy Initiative (FAI), a nonprofit founded in 1998 by concerned parents and grandparents and the largest private funder of food allergy research in the world, provided financial support for this study. "Dr. Gupta's ongoing research on food allergy prevalence among children in the U.S. is providing critical information to help us address the growing public health issue of food allergies," said Mary Jane Marchisotto, executive director of the Food Allergy Initiative. "We are committed to finding a cure for food allergies and this study provides additional insight about why certain people have food allergies and others do not."

OP	Saturday, November 03, 2012 About Ratu Joni from w Crosbie Walsh in New Zealand has a point of view that I don't always agree with, but here he writes very succinctly about Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi who has been appointed as a consultant to the Constitution Committee and apparently disturbed one of our current leaders when Ratu Joni was part of a delegation from Bau with a position that contradicted the 'secular' state proviso.  Inappropriate and Appropriate Models for Fiji by Croz Walsh Two lawyers: Ratu Joni and Prof Yash Ghai Much has been made of the presence of Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi at the presentation of the Bau submission to the Constitution Commission which urged making Fiji a Christian State. The suggestion is that Ratu Joni supported each and every part of the submission. I do not think so. I think he was present as Roko Tui Bau, the leader of his vanua who, having explained his position, abided by the majority decision of others, while keeping his musket dry for other opportunities to influence opinions. Rishab Nair, writing in the Fiji Economic Forum on Facebook is of similar opinion but is disappointed Ratu Joni appeared to support all the Bau submission. He writes: "Somehow I think that's not his own personal feelings. He was after all the most liberal [of people] and someone I looked up to. Well, not anymore." I think Rishab judges too soon. Ratu Joni does not have knee-jerk reactions to situations. He is a learned, thoughtful man with a long and enviable record of good works seeking tolerance and understanding between Fiji's several communities. I have little doubt he has tortured himself on how best to react to the many divisive issues that have buffeted Fiji in recent years, and particularly on how to moderate the largely unwarranted fears and extreme opinions of some of his own people. My assessment is that his presence at the submission showed he was more concerned about the the outcome of the war than on the short term outcome of the battle. Ratu Joni is a deeply committed Christian who, conceivably, has "gone along" with the Christian State proposal because he thinks it will not infringe on the religious rights of non-Christians. But I doubt this is his reason. I believe I am supported in this view by  the main message of most of his recent speeches. Whatever the gathering or occasion, he has spoken of the need for respect and tolerance between ethnic groups and  religions, and on some occasions he has been outspoken in his opposition to the proposal to establish a Christian State. I cite three examples from Wikipedia . In March 2005, speaking to the Lautoka Rotary Club, he said the proposal would hinder a "correct relationship" between the overwhelmingly Christian ethnic Fijians and the mainly Hindu and Muslim Indo-Fijian community, and could lead to  division and conflict. Speaking  May 2005, he said the proposal had its roots in the initial conversion of chiefs to Christianity and in the Deed of Cession, in which the chiefs ceded sovereignty to the United Kingdom in 1874.  He considered that in a multi-faith country like Fiji, it would not be wise to establish any one faith. In an earlier address to a Hindu gathering on 28 March, he criticized government politicians for couching pronouncements in purely Christian terms. "When national leaders address the people of Fiji in specifically Christian terms, whatever the occasion, nearly half of our people are excluded," he said. "When prayer in mixed company is uttered in terms of a purely Christian God, we unintentionally omit and diminish others present of different faiths. When we use Christian symbolism to promote reconciliation, forgiveness and unity, we discount the contribution and equally rich traditions extant in other faiths and cultural traditions." I am confident that Ratu Joni's presence at Bau's submission to the Constitution Commission was out of respect for the views of many of his vanua. He has often said chiefs should listen to their people.  He was listening, and he was present, as protocol required, while others presented the Bau submission,  but I am quietly confident he was not in  agreement with this particular proposal. In my copy of A Personal Perspective: The Speeches of Joni Madraiwiwi he wrote: "Professor Walsh, Perspectives about life and about my country. The more I reflect about Fiji the less I seem to understand! But the love of homeland encompasses its bright and darker sides as well as in between. Warm regards, ni moce mada. Joni and Lusi, XII.XII.MMVIII." Here is a short address he made to St Agnes Parish in Suva in September 2003. Read it, and then tell me this man wants a Christian State imposed on Fiji. On Being a Good Neighbour: A Personal Perspective Christ simplified the Ten Commandments into 'Thy shall love the Lord God will all thy strength and thy neighbour as thyself.' While the Commandment to love the Lord with all they strength is absolute, our human weakness seeks to limit it -- to restrict that love to our own kind or to those we are comfortable with. The Gospels make so such distinction: Indeed they place a particular emphasis on the poor, weak and disadvantaged. So, we have little choice if we are to be faithful to our Lord's Commandment. However, to do it on our own is impossible, we need divine assistance. As a Fijian, I am secure about my rights in this country. I believe they are adequately protected by the Constitution. No one can take away our rights unless we allow them to. Our rights are an issue that can only be protected by a determination to incubate those values within ourselves and to hand them on to the next generation. Too often we blame other communities for the plight of the indigenous Fijians. But we Fijians own 83% of the land in this country, and out leaders have led Fiji since independence except for the year when Mr Chaudhry was in government. We are largely responsible for our own situation and need to accept that fact. No one seeks to take anything from us. Indeed there is much goodwill from other communities. Yet we continue the debate as if no one else matters. I was blessed with two wonderful parents. Our home in Levuka was open to everyone. But my parents were not unusual. When children are nurtured in such an atmosphere, they take it with them as they grow into adults -- because what they learn is that, while people may have different ways of doing things, they are still human beings, with a need for love, friendship and social interaction. When you are blessed with friendships in all communities, you realize how wonderful this country is. Our differences become a matter for celebration and not division. The glue that holds this country together is not our leaders but you, the ordinary, decent God-fearing folk of all ethnic communities and faiths. Your compacts with each other every day make the connections and ties that unite us. Please go on doing that. For I have very little hope that our politicians will do likewise. 5 comments: Anonymous said... I like the chief's (Ratu Joni) dig at the end at the politicians. He's a man with rank, education and religion (Christianity). A man for all peoples. And for our time perhaps. I think his time will come. However the ball is in the court of the religious leaders. And since Christianity is the predominant religion then it is the Christians decision that will amount to much. And as Methodists are the biggest group of Christians then it is they who need to get it right for the sake of all others. More rests on the church president's head than he may realize in my opinion. The present noises coming through the media are promising. He is calling for Chistian state yet acknowledging the pluralistic society that Fiji is. From an article I read somewhere, he does not appear to be intimidated by the state. So things look hopeful at this point. The only negative I see in the latest gathering of religious leaders is that its 'in front of the cameras' so everyone may be on best behaviour. But who knows, perhaps they have been meeting regularlay already on a less formal basis away from the cameras. Yes Babasiga, a dialogue. To fight the common enemy. I doubt if there has been much interfaith discussion in Fiji over the years - it's something that has been avoided I think. I enjoyed the interfaith group in Geelong that I was a member of, but I did have to be careful, tactful, and hold my tongue at times because I am convinced that my 'religion' is the way to go Yet I love the music of some other faiths, e.g. Sufi, and have met some gorgeous people such as friends who are Bahai. I think there was a dialogue of sorts following the first coup. But the events of the enusuing years give an indication of its success. So now 20 and 5 years on they get around the table again. Better luck this time hopefully. Now I am embarrassed to have quoted Crosbie Walsh because it is clear that he kowtows to the regime; He even writes this: The Ministry of Information paid my travel costs, five days accommodation at Holiday Inn, they provided a vehicle to take me around, and gave me the temporary use of a tape recorder and a "dongle" to avoid the hotel's high charge for internet access. Vinaka, Sharon, Sharleen, Don and the three drivers, especially Freddie. He like everyone else interested in a brighter future for Fiji has to make his choice on what ground to make his stand. He sees it the way he does and openly discloses it. Fair enough, but his decision not to meet with certain leaders because their views were already known to him is weak. Not if he want's to retain some integrity. Links About Me Introducing Peceli and Wendy. Babasiga (pronounced bambasinga) is the dry land of Macuata in northern Fiji - our place in the sun in Fiji.

NA	European Union Frederick Florin/Agence France-Presse -- Getty Images Updated: Nov. 5, 2012 The European Union, made up of 27 member countries, evolved out of the European Coal and Steel Community, formed in 1950 by Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands to help revive heavy industry in a region still staggering after World War II. While the organization had a practical side, just as important was its broader vision: that economic cooperation could bring an end to the region's centuries-old history of national conflicts. In October 2012, the union was awarded the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize , for its role in building peace and reconciliation over six decades among enemies who fought Europe's bloodiest wars. The award came as the union faced an economic crisis that threatens its cohesion and future. The award also seemed to illuminate competing visions of Europe as both historical unifier and meddlesome overlord, recalling deep strains within the bloc, primarily between Germany and other European nations over Berlin's insistence on austerity to resolve the euro crisis, measures that have brought pain to Greece and Spain in particular. Unemployment in both countries is at 25 percent, and Greece's GDP has shrunk by 25 percent, close to the drop seen in the United States in the Great Depression. The crisis has pushed the union toward greater integration, with agreements for tighter fiscal coordination and joint bank regulation and deposit insurance, but has also subjected it to strains that have raised the question of whether the euro, and the union, can be pulled through in their current form. Thorbjorn Jagland, the former Norwegian prime minister who is chairman of the panel awarding the prize, said there had been deep concern about Europe's destiny as it faces the debt-driven woes that have placed the future of the single currency in jeopardy. He described it as a signal focusing on the union's historical role binding France and Germany together after World War II and its perceived impact in spreading reconciliation and democracy beyond the Iron Curtain that once divided Europe and on to the Balkans. Some Europeans questioned whether the bloc's track record in the Balkan wars of the 1990s and in the current economic crisis justified a prize for spreading peace. European officials also immediately raised the question of who would accept the peace prize on behalf of the bloc's often bickering members, divided by tensions between its more affluent north and its struggling south. Members are also frequently at odds over personality differences and critical questions, like whether Turkey should be admitted and whether the euro zone should include more countries than its current 17. At the Union's headquarters in Brussels, several figureheads compete for prominence, including Mr. Barroso, the president of the European Commission, which enforces European treaties, and Herman Van Rompuy , the president of the European Council, which represents heads of European Union governments. Europeans Losing Faith in Their Parliament In a push for "more Europe" as the solution to the euro crisis, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and others have sketched elaborate visions of an elected European president and executive overseen by a strengthened parliament. But the current state of the Parliament -- including corruption scandals and the appearance of excessive lobbying -- has added to doubts about the likelihood of that prospect. A poll conducted in November 2011 found "a sharp decline" in the European Parliament's image compared with a similar poll in 2008, when Europe's economic crisis bloomed. The Eurobarometer, conducted by TNS, found that 26 percent of the 26,594 people sampled from across Europe had a "negative" view of the Parliament, an increase of 9 percentage points. The Parliament, with 754 members, is the only directly elected part of the apparatus that runs the European Union. But the percentage of eligible voters who have cast ballots every five years has declined to just over 40 percent from more than 60 percent in less than a quarter of a century. In the meantime, lobbyists seem to have stepped into the widening gap between citizens and their representatives. On many days, parts of the parliament building have the feel of a glitzy trade show. Business lobbies organize conferences in meeting rooms and host meals in the dining rooms at the invitation of friendly members. They also mount exhibitions -- some in seeming violation of the Parliament's own guidelines. In summer 2012, there was a string of controversies in the Parliament when the authorities in Austria, Romania and Slovenia accused representatives from their nations of abusing their positions. Those accusations followed a scandal that began in 2011, when members were caught on camera apparently prepared to propose amendments in return for cash in a sting operation conducted by The Sunday Times of London. In July 2012, the Romanian authorities expanded an investigation into Adrian Severin, a representative and former foreign minister, accusing him of helping Romanian companies sell "fictive services" that robbed the Parliament's budget of _436,663. Mr. Severin said by telephone that he was innocent of trading influence, calling the charges "a fairy tale" and politically motivated. He has refused to step down and can still enter the Parliament, sit on the Foreign Affairs Committee and cast votes. The scandal led to the creation of the first ethics committee and, remarkably, for the first time an explicit ban on members taking money in exchange for amending legislation. But despite the recent overhauls, representatives are allowed to hold second jobs with no limits on salaries and accept flights and accommodations without declaring all of them. By comparison, such practices are explicitly forbidden to members of the U.S. Congress. Mrs. Merkel's pledge came after Mr. Erdogan warned that the union stood in danger of losing Turkey if it was not granted membership by 2023. An ever stronger economic and political force in the region, Turkey has been in negotiations to join the bloc since 2005, and some analysts have worried that a frustrated Turkey might shift from its Western focus to building stronger ties with Moscow and Tehran. Despite Turkey's status as a NATO ally and its long-running ties to much of Europe, a number of countries, including Germany, have never fully warmed to the idea of granting it full European Union membership. Ms. Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union has even suggested that Turkey be granted instead a special status in the form of a "privileged partnership."

IN	Why does heaven have to be after death? Site navigation Human Trafficking Posted: 2005 People with power feed us fiction. We are led to believe that we can trust our governments to do the right thing most of the time and stand up for human decency, just like Andrei tricks Lilya into trusting that he and the fake passport will be her salvation. Contrary to popular belief, slavery is not dead. It is the third largest global crime, close behind drugs and arms trafficking. Inadequate laws and political apathy means human trafficking (slavery) will grow and grow... (Summary put simply) - Vulnerable people, usually poor, are deceived or forced into working abroad with promises of a better life. When they get there their passports are taken off them, they are forced to work behind locked doors and beaten or starved if they refuse. Sometimes they are killed and the threat of murder is always there. Their "masters" or "owners" make money by forcing them to work in sweatshops, dangerous jobs or as prostitutes. If the victim manages to get to the police, she is often not helped because she has no documents or the crime is not taken seriously. Because she is likely to be deported to her own country where she will probably be murdered, she doesn't usually try to contact the authorities and so human trafficking continues to grow. Trafficking Introduction What is human trafficking? Human trafficking is slave trading. Through force or by deception, people are taken from their communities so they can be exploited. Without passports in a foreign country they find they have nowhere to turn. Their "owners" use violence, starvation and murder to maintain their power over them. Victims are trafficked into a range of hazardous working conditions. Eventually I arrived in a bar in Kosovo, [and was] locked inside and forced into prostitution. In the bar I was never paid, I could not go out by myself, the owner became more and more violent as the weeks went by; he was beating me and raping me and the other girls. We were his "property", he said. By buying us, he had bought the right to beat us, rape us, starve us, force us to have sex with clients." - 21 year old Moldovan woman Why is there human trafficking? Human trafficking is a highly profitable route to wealth and power, now ranking alongside drug and weapons trafficking as the largest criminal activities. Is human trafficking a big problem? Trafficking is a worldwide phenomenon. According to the US State Department about 900,000 persons, mainly women and children, are being trafficked annually across borders worldwide. The UN believes the real figure is between 5 and 10 million, with 2 million being children used, for example, in domestic service, sweatshops, quarries and factory work. It is estimated to be a $19 billion industry. How do the victims become slaves? Respond to an attractive 'employment opportunity' ad Trust the promises of a boyfriend or friend Accept a promise of marriage Agree to a deal arranged by poverty-stricken parents Or they are abducted How do the traffickers keep them enslaved? Take away their documents Blackmail them Threaten violence to children and family Beat, rape and humiliate Lock them in and starve them Sell and resell them around international networks Many countries have no specific laws against trafficking, so victims are reluctant to report their experiences for fear of being killed, prosecuted or deported as illegal immigrants. Even in countries with laws, there is little real protection for victims. The one shelter in the UK will only assist if the victim agrees to prosecute their captors. With their horrific history of abuse, the threat of being killed is too real for most to take that risk. So some seek asylum but do not tell the whole truth. This backfires on them as their evidence is found not to be credible in court. The Lasting Solution The solution is very simple and possible, but we each have to want it. Fulfillment and peace are already within us, not on the outside, and we must each know this is true. Only then will there be a real possibility that the needless problems and craziness will dissipate. Imho, Prem Rawat has an answer that can help us all because he backs up his words with the practical experience of true love or peace. Imho, it will be hard for some people to give up the power, corruption and lies that make them rich and respected in influential circles, but anyone with a sincere desire for peace and understanding can learn to turn within and fulfill their life before it is too late. Political changes will never fully work unless we all change as well, but some actions are being taken in the hope that they will save some suffering. (The links below may be out of date) (on the web) Human Rights Watch needs people to sign letters to help women in Africa and this would help with many issues including trafficking Poverty is a major reason for victims becoming enslaved. There are some fast, easy actions that can be taken on the 4-Ever poverty page Petition against Human Trafficking (Summary put simply) - This petitions urges governments to do more to stop slavery, now known as human trafficking. This includes: giving heavier penalties to traffickers (slave-drivers); signing United Nations agreements; training more people to spot traffickers; protecting victims of trafficking and helping them as much as possible; not to send victims back to their own country where they may be murdered; not to treat victims as if they are criminals because they are not. We call on all governments to: Increase efforts to combat trafficking. Give full protection to the victims. Pass laws so that punishments for human trafficking reflect the extremely serious nature of the crime. Sign and ratify the United Nations Protocol on Trafficking in Persons (2000) and the UN Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers (1990). Train professionals to look for the signs that a person is a victim of trafficking. Support victims of trafficking with counselling, legal, medical, financial and practical assistance appropriate to their special needs, ie severe trauma, humiliation and constant threat of death. Provide support regardless of whether the victims co-operate with prosecutions. A trafficked person is not an illegal immigrant or a criminal and their full human rights must be ensured. Provide support from the moment they are recognised until the time they are happily repatriated or given citizenship. Ensure that all anti-trafficking efforts are non-discriminatory and do not adversely affect other vulnerable groups like refugees or migrants Increase public awareness of the hows and whys of trafficking to help prevent vulnerable people becoming victims and to help in identifying possible victims and traffickers I agree and want to sign this petition Letter Writing Letter writing is an effective way of making politicians take action. This sample letter may help you get started. There is also an excellent letter writing guide at Amnesty International Sample letter about Human Trafficking Dear I wish to express my concern about human trafficking and the treatment of its victims. Vulnerable people, seeking a better life because of poverty, domestic violence and other pressures they have no control over, are wickedly exploited, often sexually abused, raped, beaten, starved and otherwise humiliated by heartless men who make a god of power and money. But when such a situation is discovered, the trafficker is often not punished appropriately because of slack laws or because the victim is too afraid and traumatized to co-operate with the prosecution. As long as this state of affairs continues, the trafficking will increase because traffickers can make vast profits and get away with it. I understand that a Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings will shortly come before the European Parliament which will make trafficking a human rights issue. This will give far more support to the victims and I heartily welcome this. However, I believe there is indecision on some points so I urge you to fully support the following measures so the inhumanity and injustice can be drastically reduced as soon as possible: a) Trafficked people should be granted a minimum reflection period of three months. This would allow them to remain in the country legally while they recover from their ordeal and make an informed decision about their future. b) During this time, trafficked people should have access to the full range of assistance, protection and support services. As well as the measures already set out in the draft convention, these should include financial support, educational, training and employment opportunities, including the possibility of obtaining a work permit. c) Trafficked people should be granted residence permits in order to be involved in legal or administrative proceedings, or where they have suffered or are at risk of serious harm or abuse. Permits should be for a period of at least six months and should be renewable, with the possibility of permanent residence being granted, especially to those who remain vulnerable. These measures are fundamental to the human rights of trafficked people and should be taken regardless of whether a trafficked person co-operates with any prosecution.
OP	Holby City: Is this something else that might require a doughnut? ( Series 14, ep.50 )  The main action this week was in AAU and Keller, with Darwin as this week's comedy relief. I never thought I'd hear myself say that. To the hurly burly of AAU first, and the hot news is that Luc's camper van was clamped. The other hot news was that Wolfie had the chance of a nice job in Brighton -- now Luc's back, there's no job for Wolfie at Holby. This was just as well, because Luc was noticing some troubling things about Wolfie. For one thing, he's hardly ever seen without having Nurse McKee attached to his face, which has got to be awkward and inconvenient, not least for the patients. For another thing, he had trembly hands. Again, not something to inspire patient confidence, and also a tell-tale sign of Camoxidan addiction. Luc did what any self-respecting maverick doctor would do, and covertly took a sample of Wolfie's hair -- or should we call it pelt -- from his jacket while Wolfie wasn't wearing it, and had it tested. This is not technically legal, but who cares when it came up with the evidence that Wolfie has been full of Camoxidan for at least months. This explains the trembly hands and the fact that he can't put a pressure bandage on to save his life. Or, more accurately, to save someone else's life. There was a big showdown, Wolfie stomped off to Brighton and Eddi failed to stomp with him -- but she did try to cheer herself up after his departure by popping one of his dodgy pills herself. Are we now going to have to endure Eddi's descent into drugs hell? I had enough of that when it was Mark "Jesus" Williams who at one stage was forever nipping off to the gents for a mid-shift enlivener. Meanwhile, almost everyone on Keller was tense, awaiting the results of the report into the death of Nice Mr Mooney. Chantelle wasn't tense, because she's way too sunny for that type of thing and she also had a box of mini doughnuts as a relaxation aid. I do admire Chantelle's thinking. Serena didn't admire it that much, but she did have a sneaky doughnut anyway. Serena's controversial initiative of the week was to fast track patients by popping tubes up or down them to have a look-see before she'd done any X-rays or boring stuff like that. It saves time, but doesn't work when you have patients who inconveniently have all their organs the wrong way round. Victory for Ric and his old-fashioned, methodical approach once again, but he assured Serena this didn't mean he would let her take the blame over Mr Mooney. As it turned out, no-one is getting the blame for Mr Mooney, as the report came back as "no blame attached." There were more than strong clues that this is not the last we're going to hear of this story, though. Not judging by the mass of emails Hanssen received with the subject line, "Blood on your hands." We do need to be concerned about our favourite super-tall Swede. Darwin was a bit quiet, because Jac was away at a conference and Oli had gone with her to carry her bag. He'd also left his phone behind, and Jonny Mac saw an opportunity to wind Tara up by sending her racy texts from Oli's phone. She neatly (and a tad predictably, it must be said) turned the tables on him by sending back texts that seemed to indicate that Jac was having an affair with a millionaire. It was quite sweet, because Jonny kept pretending to Mo that he wasn't bothered -- "This is Naylor we're talking about" -- but he so is. Next time : Hanssen in deadly danger! Sacha in the doghouse with Chrissie! And a pregnancy scare for Jac! I loved the light relief comedy moments this week, and i dont know about anyone else but I like johnny more when hes with Mo, being mischievous, than when hes with Jac. He kinda cramps her style?! It was about time they brought in a love interest though, and hes fairly likeable. I still miss Irish Dr Greg though AAU ans Wolfie business was all pretty heavy but im glad hes gone. Sacha and Luc can set about saving Eddi now! Lookinf forward to next week as always PLA, and two quick apologies -- firstly for any spelling mistakes; newly acquired iphones take some getting used to on the typing front! And secondly, i tried to "like" the review and do a thumbs up but my clumsy great fingers on this sensitive little iphone and it pressed the thumbs down!! Im sorry! I have now reloaded the page and done a thumbs up aswell! You're forgiven, Nikki. I also suffer from fat fingers when it comes to trying to write things on an iPhone. Plus there's the helpful spell-check thing that insists it knows better than you do what you want to say. I'm glad Wolfie's gone. I liked him (visually) the first week he appeared, but after that he got too "mwah hah hah!!" and I didn't like the effect he had on Eddi. She's always been able to crawl in with a hangover and still maintain her Best Nurse status, but under Wolfie's influence she's been a bit of a mess. I didn't really go for the idea that the loss of one man and the influence of another would make her so reckless and change her entire attitude to her work. On the plus side, her hair has never looked nicer.
NA	All the way win to the Eagles Sept. 21, 2012, 11:39 a.m. THE Collie Eagles met the Busselton Magpies at the Eaton recreation centre for their last game of the football league's netball competition qualifying rounds last Sunday. Collie started without Melanie Lasisz who suffered a hamstring injury in the local grand final on Tuesday night, so little sister Aimee Towler stepped into the centre position and upcoming junior player Sheridan King into wing defence. Busselton came out strongly but were unable to get past the impressive defensive duo of Nicole Jones and Ellena Clazie who get better and better with each outing. At the other end of the court Kristy Bronickis was outstanding at goal attack for the Eagles shooting a near perfect game in a best on court performance. The Eagles increased their lead each quarter to win 58 to 25. The only negatives for Collie were Aimee Towler leaving the court in the last quarter with an ankle injury and Colleen DeAngelis struggling through the game with a knee injury. Collie face the Bunbury Bulldogs next Sunday in the elimination semi final and will need all eight players fit.  Collie defeated Bunbury by 11 early in the season before Bunbury turned the tables in their last encounter, winning by a huge margin. It should prove to be a very entertaining game.
IN	TPP Deep Dive: Skewing Lawsuits in Favor of Copyright Plaintiffs This post is the first in a series of posts in which Public Knowledge will explain our concerns with the Trans-Pacific Partnership's (TPP) copyright provisions. For the time being, this series will work off of the US's copyright proposals [pdf] for the TPP that were leaked and made available February 2011. That leaked text from February 2011 is the most recent text that is publicly available. One of the more troubling ways in which the US proposal for the TPP copyright provisions differs from current US copyright law is how it skews copyright cases in favor of the copyright owner. US Law: The Plaintiff Must Prove Her Case Under US copyright law, when a copyright owner sues a user she must prove that the work at issue has a valid copyright, that she owns that copyright, and that the user infringed the copyright in some way. In civil cases the copyright owner must prove all this "by a preponderance of the evidence" -- basically, that each of her claims is more likely true than not. If the copyright owner can't meet that burden, let's say, if she only proves that her allegations are 30% likely to be true, then she loses. TPP: The Defendant Must Prove the Plaintiff Is Lying The proposed TPP text would flip all of this on its head. Article 10.2 of the US proposal (linked above) requires TPP countries to presume that "the person whose name is indicated in the usual manner as the author, producer, performer, or publisher of the work" owns the copyright in that work. The same section also requires member countries to presume that the work in question is protected by copyright. So, if a person claiming to be the copyright owner has simply slapped her name on a work where you would normally expect the author's name to go, the court would be required to assume that the work is protected by copyright and that person is the rightful owner of that copyright. Problems with the TPP Presumptions Beyond simply being a bad idea, this system would be ripe for abuse. Plaintiffs could easily sue for infringement of works they don't actually own, and it would be up to the defendant to track down how the work was created and subsequently licensed to prove that the plaintiff did not actually own the work. This can be a tremendous burden on a user who may know little to nothing about the claimed copyright owner and her business relationships prior to the lawsuit. Often the rights in a work are transferred from the author, who is the initial copyright owner, to intermediaries who are supposed to help the author exploit the work. These transfers of ownership are not necessarily publicly available, and the TPP would put the burden of conquering the copyright licensing thicket on the defendant rather than the plaintiff, who is the most likely to have access to information showing she is or is not the copyright owner. But wait, there's more. The TPP also requires courts to assume that the work at issue in the case is even covered by copyright at all. This means assuming that the work is copyrightable (as opposed to facts or utilitarian functions) and that the work is still protected by copyright (as opposed to works in the public domain, whose copyright term has ended). Once again, the user, rather than the copyright owner, would have the burden of digging through history and establishing when the work was created or when it was first published in order to prove that she can't be liable for using a public domain work. This also allows copyright plaintiffs to claim copyright over elements of their works that are uncopyrightable. Facts, functions, general themes -- all of these could be incorporated into a work that would be presumed copyrighted under the TPP. The burden would be on the user to show every part of the work that is not copyrightable, rather than the copyright owner showing which parts are copyrightable. On a more fundamental level, these presumptions go against the basic process of US courts. Plaintiffs bear the burden of proof; you cannot simply drag someone into court and force them to spend the time and money to prove they are not liable. Defendants could still overcome presumptions and win the lawsuit by presenting enough evidence, but the whole point is that the person making the accusations should be the one responsible for showing they're true. How Could This Get Worse? Make It Criminal. This post has been describing the impact of the TPP's copyright presumptions in the context of a civil lawsuit between private parties, but the provision would also apply to criminal cases. This just makes the contrast between US law and the TPP even more worrisome. In US criminal law, the government must prove its case against the defendant "beyond a reasonable doubt." This is an incredibly high burden to meet -- by its own terms, it means that if the prosecution in a criminal case leaves any reasonable doubt as to the defendant's guilt, the defendant must be found not guilty. The TPP wouldn't just lower that standard, but would effectively alleviate the government's burden of proving its case entirely for a very important element of the crime: that the works in questions (or the parts the defendant is accused of using) are copyrighted at all. These presumptions may sound fairly abstract, even for copyright law, but they are extremely important to how copyright law actually functions and is enforced when someone is accused of infringement by another person or the government. The TPP's copyright presumptions would not only conflict with current US copyright law, but with a fundamental element of the US court system: the accuser must be able to support her accusations. This post was written by Public Knowledge Staff Attorney Jodie Griffin. Share this: Comments Even though I agree with many of your larger points about the TPP and its process, US law already includes the kind of presumption about which Jodie complains. Section 410(c) says that a registration certificate is usually "prima facie" evidence of both the validity of copyright and the facts stated in the certificate (which would include the author). So far, that part of US law doesn't seem to have caused the kinds of problems you mention. Thanks for your comment. You're right that Section 410 provides certain presumptions for works that have been registered, but I think these TPP provisions still go beyond what 410 gives. First, Section 410 requires actual registration, while the TPP would just requires the plaintiff to have put his or her name on the work. Also, the process under Section 410 requires the Copyright Office to first examine the work and determine whether it is copyrightable, whereas the TPP just gives the plaintiff a presumption that the work is copyrightable without any government representative reviewing the work, much less a court.

By reading [...] The following post was written by Public Knowledge Senior Staff Attorney John Bergmayer. Many people use the Internet to better themselves. People use resources available online to teach themselves, or they take part in distance education. Traditional universities and web-native organizations alike are finding new ways to use the Internet for education. But the TPP could harm that, by [...] Why International IP Matters International forums provide the perfect opportunity to increase the rights of copyright owners at the expense of the public because many of these forums often lack of transparency, the negotiations are obscure, and the debates are easily disregarded as "far away". That is why, when seeking policy changes that would otherwise be unpopular domestically, well-financed industry players often turn to international forums. Once harmful provisions are codified in international rules, they are easier to adopt domestically, or if already adopted, harder to change domestically. This phenomenon -- using international negotiations to adopt provisions that cannot be adopted in the U.S. -- is not new. The term of art used to describe it is "policy laundering." How the USTR's attempts on limitations and exceptions are half hearted Copyright limitations and exceptions can correct some of these imbalances between rights of owners and users of copyrighted works. That is why it was so significant when the US Trade Representative (USTR) recently announced that it would include provisions on limitations and exceptions within the TPP. Some of these provisions leaked recently. However, if what was leaked is the entirety of the US proposal, it does disappointingly little to protect users' rights. Well, since everyone but country negotiators and industry "advisors" have been kept in the dark, it's hard to say. But Public Knowledge has been tracking international IP issues for a number of years and a draft text was leaked in February 2011, so we can make an educated guess about what might be in the TPP's IP chapter. (The agreement also covers a vast range of other issues, including ... Read More
NA	share this story Abu Qatada is a big man with an even bigger voice. The British legal system and sundry international institutions are keen to protect his human rights. This concern for his welfare owes more to his fame and his potential to cause embarrassment than to the facts of his legal case. At any given moment there are hundreds, if not thousands, of brave political dissidents who have sought refuge in the UK, yet they live in fear that they will be deported. The fate of their less fortunate friends who have already been deported convinces them they will be tortured and possibly killed by the repressive regimes they have risked their lives to challenge. In many cases they have sacrificed their careers and their security to fight for the values they associate with Britain: tolerance, pluralism, secularism, impartial justice, the separation of powers, a free media and multi-party democracy. In other words, many vilified 'asylum seekers' have taken a courageous stand for the things Abu Qatada holds in contempt. Yet, they do not have the notorious cleric's big voice or his fame. For this failing, they are mere numbers within the UK Border Agency's overloaded system, an inconvenience representing the 'third rail' of domestic politics. For example, in September the UK deported 60 Sri Lankans despite warnings that they faced torture as pay-back for their roles in the island's miserable and violent political upheaval. The human rights group Waging Peace helps Sudanese dissidents living in the UK, urging the government to recognise the danger faced by individuals and ethnic groups targeted by the Khartoum regime. According to Olivia Warham, "It is frustrating to see the time and money devoted to protecting the rights of one man, Abu Qatada, while hundreds of brave but unknown political dissidents from oppressive regimes like Sudan must fend for themselves." The campaign group No Deportations highlights the plight of dissidents who have sought refuge in the UK, only to find their testimony about what they have endured in their country of origin is not believed. It is doubly traumatic to bear the physical and psychological scars of an oppressive regime, and then to find indifference, at best, from the government you have long regarded as a shining beacon of liberty, and the very model of how you wish your own country would behave. Often they wait years for their cases to be resolved. They are left homeless in our big cities or held indefinitely at immigration removal centres, often struggling to get adequate legal representation. Yet, the popular media brackets a few benefit-leach scoundrels and thousands of opportunistic economic migrants in with those who have taken a stand against corruption, extremism and authoritarianism at home. At the heart of the Abu Qatada case is a dispiriting lesson for those relying on the UK's once honourable track record as a haven for dissidents: the rich, famous, notorious or powerful still have a better chance of justice. Abu Qatada is a big man with an even bigger voice. The British legal system and sundry international institutions are keen to protect his human rights. This concern for his welfare owes more to his fa... Abu Qatada is a big man with an even bigger voice. The British legal system and sundry international institutions are keen to protect his human rights. This concern for his welfare owes more to his fa... When it comes down to the issue of human rights, we are entirely in the hands of the government. So when your government (and prime minister) has such a questionable reputation with regards to human rights as the UK's, those that believe in equality should really think twice before supporting the country's evolution beyond a need for the European Court of Human Rights. Theresa May is right to have highlighted the need to reform the way foreign national prisoners are dealt with. If she is truly determined to root out unfairness in the current system, however, her concerns should lie with increasing the opportunities available to this group to understand and exercise their rights, and not with limiting their ability to access justice still further. if we're going to take the position that our governments are responsible for the future fates of all those who enter our countries, the deportation process should be streamlined so that decisive factors such as risk of torture are established earlier, before large amounts of time and money are spent on legal hearings.

All these so called "Brave Dissidents" should be in their own countries supporting their causes, not running away from them, if they are so brave how come they are not willing to die for their causes, thats how heros are made!!...But fleeing when the going get tough just shows a lack of comitment.... Your words are those of a very brave man, but words are easy and cheap. I mean no disrespect when I ask you if you have been in a situation where you have been tortured for what you believe in, and seen your family threatened or killed. Unless you have been personally tested, I would refrain from doubting the bravery of others. p_blogger_Rebecca Tinsley: Your words are those of a very brave man, but My family has fought two world wars for what they believe in, they did not shirk their duty by running off to a safer country, they put their lives on the line instead..Change never comes easy!, it has to be fought for, and sacrifices have to be made......

Because if he answers no, he should renounce them and be deported. While if he answers yes, a need to explain the paradox between his beliefs and bellowings becomes due. "his legal case" could be conducted in a British court. That way the validity of the evidence provided by a country that condones torture, yet still expects its word to be accepted, can be tested. "repressive regimes they have risked their lives to challenge." How is Julian, by the way? "third rail' of domestic politics." Watch out. It's a live one. "Abu Qatada" is surely subverting the tough values of the system he seeks to introduce. By not rejecting those soft infidel privileges he's revelling in. Perhaps a sort of reverse Stockholm syndrome has set in. "their testimony about what they have endured in their country of origin is not believed" Don't we now have an MRI scanner app for determining that? "the government you have long regarded as a shining beacon of liberty" Julian still ok, is he? "rich, famous, notorious or powerful" Send me your...oh! You have. Don't bother with the tax on company profits. Its optional. Loading comments... You mention Sri Lanka and Sudan in your article, may I ask how many safe, stable democracies exist beween this nation and those two? Now I know you are going to say "Ah but some of them fly here" but if you are fleeing from a government who is bent on persecuting you are they really going to allow you a passport and easy access to an aircraft? That's a good point. In the case of Sudan many people escape on foot across the very long, remote and rural border to squalid refugee camps in Chad, but they do so without ID papers, often because they had to leave in a hurry as their village was being bombed. Many have extraordinary stories of travelling across Africa and using any means they can to get to the UK. They show initiative and courage, in many cases. p_blogger_Rebecca Tinsley: That's a good point. In the case of Sudan many I thought the law, was they have to ask for asylum in the first safe country they come across. The u.k is an island with which you must travel across at least six countries before getting to the benefit haven of Dover. Loading comments... As you say, there are stories of huge obstacles to travel here amongst which are the English channel and the straits of Gibraltar. The refugee/asylum rules are clear in that the refugee/asylum seeker is required to claim that status in the first safe country they arrive in so by implication, can we assume that France for example is not a safe stable country? I'm sure our Gallic cousins would be most offended by that. So why do they need to come here for asylum when there is a perfectly safe country right under their feet. I say this not from a racist or xenophobic standpoint as I firmly believe the strong should protect the weak but in a lot of cases the system is being ignored. Loading comments... Your concluding lurch to having a go at the ''popular media'' may satisfy some politically correct need that you have but it makes no sense at all in terms of your argument. The law of the land is not the fault of the ''popular media''. The policy of the government is not the fault of the ''popular media.'' The way that policy is implemented is not the fault of the ''popular media.'' And the fact that many asylum seekers are not believed is not the fault of the ''popular media.'' I apologise for being logically inconsistent. I should have made it clearer that I have an issue with the way in which the popular media demonises all asylum seekers as benefit scroungers, when in reality the percentage who come to the UK to scrounge is small. p_blogger_Rebecca Tinsley: I apologise for being logically inconsistent.

OP	Post navigation I Have Been a Waif for Twenty Years And I pray one prayer -- I repeat it till my tongue stiffens -- Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest, as long as I am living! You said I killed you -- haunt me, then! The murdered do haunt their murderers. I believe -- I know that ghosts have wandered on earth. Be with me always -- take any form -- drive me mad! Only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! Always, always, always read your favourite books more than once. I fell in love with Wuthering Heights as a teenager because it was wild. A passionate, emotional book that every stroppy teenager can't fail to identify with. As an adult -- it is so much better. Everything that was difficult the first time (mainly who was related to who, and how) was simple, which meant I could pay attention to parts previously hidden. I think the biggest thing about Wuthering Heights is confusion at its reputation for being a love story. Yes, Catherine and Heathcliff have no ordinary connection but I can't help thinking that people who list them as a great couple must be mad! I had forgotten quite how horrible Heathcliff is and that really the book is about the very worst of human emotions: Jealousy, betrayal, revenge. What I really enjoyed during this particular read was the cathartic nature of younger Catherine and Hareton's relationship. I found it much more touching than I did the first time. I just really love Wuthering Heights . I can't write about it in any way that does it justice because it is one of my everything books. It has fantastical depths and unrestrained brilliance and it never leaves you. When I was reading it, I felt like I was Lockwood too -- looking in on this tiny rural society. Just read it . And then read it again. I had an excellent Saturday -- spent walking from Haworth to Top Withens, a ruin said to have inspired Emily Bront when she was writing Wuthering Heights . Luckily, despite being absolutely FREEZING, not only did it not rain, there were even sporadic bouts of sunshine. The walk started in Haworth village and was a seven mile round trip across open moors like this: Top Withens is next to that tiny tree in the distance! I visited the Bront Parsonage Museum again but didn't take any photos because I couldn't beat the amazingly atmospheric mist that had descended when I went last year . I am reading Shirley by Charlotte Bront at the moment, although I haven't read enough yet to talk about it. I think in terms of Bront-love The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is still my favourite, closely -- very closely -- followed by Wuthering Heights . Yes yes yes. Lovely post. I think part of the reason why so many people hate this novel is because they're taken aback by the ruthlessness of it. They come prepared to find a love story, when it's really so much more complicated than that. The bond between Heathcliff and Catherine has more to do with obsession than with love, but nevertheless, it's still passionate and unyielding and, like I said yesterday, unforgettable. Ah, Cathy and Hareton. They are the real love story of the book for me. I love the resulting peace and renewed hope that comes with their union. Also. I'm so jealous of you for walking the moors that inspired Emily Bront. I hope you don't mind. Thank you for your comment, I really like how you talk about this book because you cut straight to its heart. I find it so odd that it has an overriding reputation for being a romantic book -- the label doesn't do it justice at all! *flaps hands a bit* There is an actual place that's the ruin with the tree and I DIDN'T GO THERE! What a FOOL I am! (I got postcards with it on so I know where you're talking about, but it didn't occur to me that it was a place!) But yeah, I LOVE this book. Do you also like Jane Eyre? Cause I adore them both but apparently you're not supposed to... :s I read Wuthering Heights for the first time this past summer and loved it, but it baffles me that anyone could really consider it a love story. It's so much more, and your review makes me want to pick up it and read it again right now.
IN	Insurance equality ruling for men and women If you are a woman who needs car insurance or a man who is thinking of retiring and drawing your pension then you have less than three months to get the best deal. What impact could the new rules have on your retirement and pension? Because from December 21, 2012, insurers will have to obey a new ruling of the European Court which bans pricing insurance differently for men and women. When prices are equalised whichever sex gets the better deal now will find they have to pay more in future. Car insurance Currently women pay less to insure their car than men do because women are safer drivers. But any new insurance written from December 21 will have to average out the cost between them -- putting up the cost to women and bringing down the price to men. The Treasury estimates that car insurance for women aged 17-25 will rise on average by 24%. But the insurance premiums for men of the same age will fall by a lot less -- around 9% the Treasury says. So women -- especially young women -- should insure their car before December 21. It could be worthwhile even if the existing insurance has a few weeks to run. But talk to your insurer about penalties for cancellation. Men of course may find it worthwhile to wait until after December 21 to insure their vehicle. But remember every vehicle has to be insured even if it is not used unless it is formally off the road and a notice from DVLA has been obtained. So if your insurance is due before December 21 it will be difficult to postpone renewing unless you put your car off the road in a drive or garage, cancel your car tax and declare it off the road. Pension time At the other end of the age scale the problem is reversed.  Men who want to convert their pension pot into a pension get more per thousand pounds than women. That is because women live longer so their pension has to be spread over a longer life. The difference is only 4% or 5% so the change is likely to be small. But from December 21 annuity rates have to be genderless and men could see their pension offers fall slightly -- perhaps 10 or so a year for every 10,000 they have in their pot. So men should consider converting their pension fund before December 21. It could give them a higher income for life. Women though may not find it worthwhile to defer claiming their pension until after December 21 when they might expect a higher rate. If you take your pension now you will get it for a couple of months longer and you will have to work out how long it will take to lose more than that by the lower pension you can expect after December 21. Other cover The new gender rules apply to other insurance as well. Life and critical illness insurance will rise for women and fall for men. But health insurance and income protection will be the other way round falling in price for women but rising for men. So it may be worth women buying life insurance and men buying health cover before December 21. But only if they were going to buy it anyway and can bring forward the purchase by a week or two.

NA	So much more than a roof and four walls 'Habitat for Humanity helped us a lot with raising our kids' The Dedinca family, from left: Bukurija, Naim, Shquiponja, Arber, Adelina and Ereza in their new living room. Daughter Mimoza is absent. The Dedincas are refugees from Kosovo and they worked for their home through Habitat for Humanity. Cathie Coward/The Hamilton Spectator Sidebar TO QUALIFY  Must be in overcrowded, inadequate or unsafe housing  Have a steady income but not qualify for traditional mortgage  Contribute 500 hours of sweat equity  Have a minimum income of $25,000 a year with total family income within region's low income cut-off guidelines  Be willing to participate in Habitat projects, community activities and publicity  Be able to afford a mortgage and not have overwhelming debt  Have at least one child under age 13  Provide references The house has done its job. It has sheltered. Nurtured. It has allowed the family that dwells within it to flourish. From its porch to its second storey, from roses in front to tomatoes and peppers out back, this house -- gutted and rebuilt by Habitat for Humanity -- has become home for the seven members of the Dedinca family. Since the Kosovo refugees were presented with their keys four years ago, this house has been much more than a roof over their heads. Each Habitat home takes the work of 1,000 people to come to fruition, from those who raise funds, to those who hammer nails, to those who select the families or do the legal work. And the families themselves, who must put in 500 of their own hours of "sweat equity." Look at the Dedinca family and you'll see it is worth it. Their east Hamilton house smells of Turkish coffee and the bread Bukurija pulls from the oven for her husband Naim, a truck driver, and their five children. "I was born and raised in the country," Naim says. "My wife is a city girl. She told me, 'You sell the cows, I'll marry you.'" He sold the cows. They married. But Naim convinced her cows are not so bad and he bought more. They made a happy life in the village of Lajthisht and filled their brick and mud house with three girls and a boy. Their land rubbed shoulders with farms of aunts, uncles and cousins. Thirty people crammed into the Dedincas' house to watch TV. Adelina was 13 when Serbian forces ordered her Albanian family out of their home. Bukurija and Naim packed a few belongings, bundled the children -- and Naim's father Mehmet -- into the car and drove away. They left the house unlocked, hoping it might save the doors from being broken down. The entire house was demolished. The family made its way to Hamilton because they had cousins here. Like many refugees, they were housed at the seedy City Motor Hotel (which city hall is now expropriating) for three months. While Naim, a trained electrician, looked for work, the family collected social assistance, the children started school and they moved first into a rented house they couldn't afford and then an apartment at 45 Barlake Ave. in Stoney Creek. They stayed in the three-bedroom unit for four years. Meanwhile, another daughter -- Ereza -- was born. "We had no privacy at all," recalls Shquiponja, now 24. "It was very hard to study." And hard to feel safe. A man was fatally stabbed outside the building, another was shot in the elevator. By now Naim was doing translation work. Someone suggested he apply to Habitat for Humanity. His family needed a larger home. That's when the Dedincas met Bob McConkey, executive director of Habitat Hamilton at the time. He was recently promoted to CEO. "The thing that impressed me most about this family is how they hung together. They were all doing something to make it work." Habitat's selection committee chose the Dedinca family in the fall of 2007 for the first home built under McConkey's direction. Rather than build a new home, Habitat gutted a 90-year-old house previously owned by an elderly widow. The renos revealed knob-and-tube wiring and load-bearing beams compromised by poor plumbing. Habitat families pay market value for their house, but their mortgage payments are no more than 25 per cent of their household income. "So they can afford food, activities and education," says McConkey. Daughter Mimoza, now 22, put in much of the 500 hours of labour demanded of a Habitat family. She tore down walls. In June 2008 the five-bedroom, two bath house was ready. Missing from the dedication was Mehmet, the 96-year-old grandfather. He died just as work on the house began. The family believes he watches over their home and all the good things it has brought. Like the vegetable garden. "It's different when you taste the fruits and vegetables from your garden," Naim says proudly. "The garden brings back memories from home," says Adelina, who graduated from the social work program at Mohawk College and is looking for a job. "We had started from zero," says Shquiponja, also a Mohawk grad, who works as a hair stylist. Mimoza graduated from McMaster University with a degree in political science and peace studies. She is the first Dedinca to graduate from university and is contemplating doing her master's.
NA	There is no exemption from mental health problems It was reported in January 2012 that Leeds United defender Andy O'Brien was to resume training after receiving treatment for depression. In November 2011 he had refused to play in a match against Bolton, which led to his being disciplined. It was only later that it transpired that he had been suffering from depression at the time. Interestingly, back in June 2011 (before the situation with Andy O'Brien), Leeds United Football Club had announced its support for the ' Love Your Mind ' campaign. The Leeds United squad boarded the 'Love Your Mind' bus to kick off the Leeds leg of the bus tour around the country and had supported Leeds Mind for some time by fundraising for the charity and helping to stamp out the stigma and discrimination experienced by so many people with mental health problems. This goes to show how difficult it can be to recognise mental illness in people; despite being aware of mental health conditions even the managers and players at Leeds United weren't able to spot mental illness in their ranks. The story of Andy O'Brien is another reminder that depression and other forms of mental illness can affect anyone, even famous people whose fame and fortune so many of us covet. Other famous people have hit the headlines with reports of mental health problems, including Catherine Zeta Jones, Emma Thompson, Mel Gibson, Elton John, Marcus Trescothik and Frank Bruno. Nobody is exempt from becoming mentally ill and it is estimated that one in four people will experience a mental health problem at some point in their lives [i] . Yet mental illness is still a taboo subject to a large degree, which is failing those who suffer from mental health problems. More needs to be done to support people who are suffering from mental illness and put an end to stigma and discrimination. There is good evidence to suggest that being out of work is detrimental to a person's mental health (see the Royal College of Psychiatrists website for more information) and the benefits of keeping valued employees at work are obvious from an organisational perspective. That's why free, professional help is available for employers/line managers on employee mental (and physical) health issues from the Health for Work Adviceline on 0800 0 77 88 44 .

IN	Bungo In The Back Lanes FAQs We want to make more of our web presence for this Back Lanes event, so we thought we'd start by compiling a list of frequently asked questions. Let us know if there's anything we've forgotten! When is this year's Bungo In The Back Lanes? Saturday 23rd June 1-4pm. Whose permission do I need to set up a table? No-one's, if it's in or behind your back garden. If you'd like to advertise what your stall is doing, let us know and we'll put it on the Bungo Map and flyers. How much does it cost to set up a stall? We ask that stallholders donate 10% of any takings to the Strathbungo Society. This enables us to pay for organising, insuring and advertising the event. The Strathbungo Society is a registered charity: SCO38276. The event costs around 1,000 to stage. I don't have a back garden on a lane, can I set up a table? Yes. First of all, ask anyone you know who has a space on the lanes and see if you can set up there. If not, come out at around 12.30 on the day and set up wherever you can squeeze in. It should be apparent by then if someone's setting up or not. The lane with the most available space is Nithsdale/Regent. Can I borrow a table from the Society? Sorry, we can only afford to hire tables and chairs for the use of Society stalls, bars and tea gardens. You don't necessarily need a table -- people use all sorts of combinations of boxes and chairs to display their wares! And if you do want one there are some folding garden tables available at Lidl on Victoria Rd just now(April 2012) for less than 40. I'd like to sell home baking or food, what do I need to do? You must contact the food safety department of Glasgow City Council who will examine the cooking premises being used prior to the event and spot-check on the day.  Phone 0845 2701558. Email: foodsafety@glasgow.gov.uk . Can I set up a BBQ in our garden? In order to get the go-ahead for the event his year we've been in contact with the local fire brigade. They'd prefer it if there were no BBQs other than the one on Marywood Lane which is arranged by the Society. Will the event be cancelled or postponed if there's bad weather? It's never been called off yet! Baring a hurricane (which might cause a spot of bother with the gazebos) the event has and will go ahead in all weathers. It's always nicer in the sunshine but even on damp days we tend to get a decent turnout of locals. We'll post a daily weather update on the Bungo Blog for the five days preceding the event. I don't want to hold a stall myself but I've got some things I'd like to donate, where can I take them? Unopened bottles and good-quality gifts can be donated to the Strathbungo Society's tombola and bottle stalls by dropping them off at 53 Queen Square. If it's jumble you're wanting rid of, ask the neighbours if they're doing bric-a-brac stall and would sell your stuff, or keep an eye on the blog. Can I set up a stall to raise money for another charity? Of course, if you let us know in advance we can advertise it on the Bungo Map. We do not expect a donation from stalls for other charities. I live on Vennard Gardens, why don't you have stalls in our lanes? In the past there's been a lack of demand. Our insurance only covers the back lanes we usually operate in. However, if there's enough interest in future we'd happily extend the event over to the Gardens. Good news, David. We've confirmed the insurance and this year the event will be extended to cover that section of Moray Place and the lane between Vennard Gardens and Marywood Square. Let us know what events and stalls you'll be holding and we'll put you on the Bungo map. Hi David, as you'll see from the Vennard Gardens query above, the main problem is that we have to specify on our public liability insurance the area the event takes place in and anything outwith these areas is not covered. We're currently applying for this year's insurance so I have asked our treasurer whether we can include this stretch of Moray Place without pushing the costs up.

IN	A Voice for the People of Christchurch A new website "Christchurch Voices" is poised to become the voice of the people of Christchurch. The combination of limited democracy in Christchurch and very large issues for which no solution has yet been found, has left thousands of Christchurch residents feeling angry and frustrated. After two years exhortations to be patient are wearing exceptionally thin. Many people are still living in broken houses with timelines for repairs stretching further into the future than many, especially the elderly, are able to conceive. Those on TC3 properties are unable to sell or repair and many are mired in the eastern suburbs for which there is apparent plan or timeline for reconstruction. Accusations that residents are merely whingers and moaners, has served only to add insult to injury. Christchurch Voices website gives people a vital voice with links to dozens of interviews with Christchurch personalities such as Garry Moore and Mike Coleman, city councillors Peter Beck and Glenn Livingstone, community leaders such as the voice of the elderly John Patterson, homeowners who have been caught up in the various scenarios, business people and tradespeople. The range of topics is therefore large ranging from issues with land, GV, insurance and EQC to the closure of schools and the CBD. Perhaps most telling are the heartfelt stories of those caught up in what has become a veritable two year saga. In voicing their opinions and telling their stories, those interviewed are providing an insight into conditions in parts of Christchurch and simultaneously issuing a warning to all who live on this shaky island. All New Zealanders should be paying attention to the issues surrounding land, EQC and insurance companies because deficits in systems, inequities and mismanagement could literally 'come home' to haunt us all if they are not rectified and satisfactory systems put in place. Insurance issues relating to indemnity versus full replacement value and heritage buildings are already affecting the country as a whole, and more changes are on the way. Christchurch is a moveable feast. While some reconstruction is underway, other crises are looming. The April deadline for people in the red zone to move has homeowners and those renting in these areas, some of which were declared red as recently as a month ago, anxious about finding alternative accommodation. Accommodation itself is a contentious issue. Rents have risen dramatically as have house prices putting them out of the reach of many. Christchurch voices, will therefore be keeping a finger on the pulse through the voices of those interviewed. Gordon Campbell: If the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal was a new car you probably wouldn't buy it, or at least not from this dealership. There will be no chance of a test drive with this baby. The pre-conditions for the TPP trade pact mean that New Zealanders will not be informed what is in the agreement before it comes into force, even though some ingredients could well render central government liable to being sued... More&gt;&gt; Foreign Minister Murray McCully has confirmed that New Zealand will vote in favour of the resolution on the status of Palestine, due to go before the United Nations General Assembly this morning. But the Minister says a UN resolution is "a poor substitute for direct negotiations between the two parties". More&gt;&gt; To put it into perspective a 10% pay disparity means women working fulltime in New Zealand would effectively stop being paid from today, while men similarly employed would stay on the payroll until the end of year. More&gt;&gt; "While the Ministry of Education's new payroll project is still in its early stages, the number of issues resulting from the payroll transition has been unacceptable. The review will be comprehensive and thorough," says Mr Foss.

NA	share this story The summer season has not even officially started yet in the U.S. and already people are cranking up the a/c, boxing away the sweaters, seeking out the best swimming hole, and plotting how to avoid sweat stains. It's about to get a lot worse. A recent study conducted by Stanford University scientists has concluded that if greenhouse gas concentrations continue to increase, many regions in the world will probably experience an irreversible rise in summer temperatures within the next 20 to 60 years. LiveScience explains that a single heat wave or warm day is not a sign of global warming. But while an individual weather event cannot be attributed to a warming world, more long-term trends are accepted in the scientific community as evidence of man-made global warming. The recent Stanford study, which will be published this month in the journal Climatic Change Letters , found that middle latitude regions of Europe, China and North America (including the U.S.) will likely see extreme shifts in summers temperatures within the next 60 years. In just the next two decades, tropical regions of Africa, Asia and South America could see permanent and "unprecedented" summer heat. The most immediate rise in extreme temperatures is expected to occur in the tropics. Last year tied with 2005 as the hottest year on record, with the average worldwide temperature 1.12 degrees Fahrenheit above normal, according to the National Climatic Data Center. The Associated Press reports, "Most atmospheric scientists attribute the change to gases released into the air by industrial processes and gasoline-burning engines." This is man-made global warming. The Stanford study's lead author, Noah Diffenbaugh, sought to determine when the current hottest temperatures would become "the new normal." He says, "According to our projections, large areas of the globe are likely to warm up so quickly that, by the middle of this century, even the coolest summers will be hotter than the hottest summers of the past 50 years." Diffenbaugh and co-author Martin Scherer came to this conclusion after analyzing over 50 climate model experiments, including both computer simulations of 21st century predictions and 20th century simulations that accurately predicted the Earth's climate over the past 50 years. Beyond perhaps a need to stock up on sunglasses and deodorant, what is the significance of these findings? According to Diffenbaugh, this dramatic rise in seasonal temperatures could severely affect human health and agriculture. Regarding health, heat waves can kill. As Diffenbaugh cites, heat waves in 2003 killed an estimated 35,000 people in Europe. Last year, a record heat wave in Russia killed 700 people per day . As for agriculture, new research reveals that global warming has hindered crop yields. Higher temperatures cause dehydration and prevent pollination, resulting in a rise in food prices . Other studies suggest that warmer winters keep pests alive longer, allowing them to carry plant diseases, and greenhouse gases affect a plant's structure, reducing its protection abilities. The Stanford report comes amid many other dire global warming predictions. One recent study found that rising sea levels could threaten 180 U.S. coastal cities by 2100. Reuters reports cities including Miami, New Orleans, Tampa, and Virginia Beach could lose over 10 percent of their land area by the end of this century. Scientists and government planners announced in May that heavy rains, deep snowfalls, monster floods and deadly droughts signal a "new normal" of extreme U.S. weather events influenced by climate change. How many looming threats and even visible evidence are needed before serious action is taken to fight global warming? Instead of recognizing that another air conditioner is just a bandaid on our warming world, climate talks are expected to miss the Kyoto deadline, climate scientists are receiving death threats , and global emissions of energy-related carbon dioxide were the highest ever last year. Will significant action against global warming have to wait until we can't take the heat?

The harbingers of a warming planet vary across the American landscape. In the Gulf states, it's monster hurricanes. In the Midwest, swarms of tornadoes. In the East it's those killer heat waves and blizzards. But in the West, we just burn. Last year, Congress debated, dawdled and dithered. This year is more of the same. The bottom line remains that Congress has still not passed legislation to curb carbon pollution and boost renewable energy solutions. Loading comments... This past May was the seventh warmest on record for land temperatures. The combined land and ocean temperature was 0.90F above the 20th century average of 14.8C (58.6F). Temperatures during May 2011 were warmer than average for much of the world's land surface, with the warmest temperature anomalies occurring over northwestern Africa, most of Europe and Russia, southwestern Asia, Alaska, and northwestern Canada. But this is all BS, right? This is all just data collected by .......Ph.D. climatologists who can think of no better way to make a living than to make up big scary stories about how the earth is heating up.

That way we won't be wasting our time bickering about nonsense like climate change. Climate change? The climate is ALWAYS changing. Blaming it on the combustion of fossil fuels is complete nonsense. Just because carbon dioxide absorbs infrared photons, and just because we are putting 30 billion tons of this waste into the atmospher each year..just because the ice caps and glaciers are melting... none of that is any reason to even begin to suspect that our primitive energy sources are wrecking our planet...

And one can understand the ever rising shrillness of the protestations and epithets as the evidence mounts and even the most stalwart champions of the cause admit that 1) it is in fact warming, 2) that CO2 is in fact a greenhouse gas, 3) that we humans are in fact responsible for the increasing level of CO2 in the atmosphere, 4) the grudging admission that rise is in fact causing at least part of the warming, and most recently, 5) the paper co-authored by none other than the Surface Stations Project's own Anthony Watts that found that there is no net urban heat island bias in the temperature record, it having already been accounted for in the analysis of the data, just as has been pointed out from the outset.

The eerily lethargic sun shows no signs of perking up, solar physicists say. The sun may wallow in inactivity for the next decade -- or longer, which could affect Earth's climate. The sun has been unusually placid lately. In 2008, the solar wind slowed to a 50-year low, coinciding with the least active point in the 11-year sunspot cycle. That dip in activity has also been deeper and longer than usual. Now, other diagnostic measurements of the sun also point to weird behaviour, suggesting the normal sunspot cycle may be interrupted. "The sunspot cycle may be going into hibernation," says Frank Hill of the National Solar Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico. He and other researchers are presenting their findings this week at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Solar Physics Division in Las Cruces, New Mexico. An onset of quiet behaviour might also help scientists clarify how much the sun affects Earth's climate. The sun's solar cycle was interrupted once before during the so-called Maunder minimum from 1645 to 1715, when almost no sunspots appeared. You seem to have somehow missed this below, fumes - here it is again: ----------------------------------------\\... Pop quiz for you fumes: Given that the Sun has in the past few years been at a minimum in its sunspot cycle and the Earth has nonetheles-s gone through some of its warmest years on instrument-al record, how in your mind will an extended reduction or lack of sunspots cause another "mini ice age within a decade"? EVEN if the sun were to quieten down appreciabl-y for the rest of this century, it would still be business as usual for global warming. The sun goes through an 11-year solar cycle during which its luminosity varies according to the number of sunspots appearing on its face. The normal cycle has a small effect on Earth's weather. But sometimes lulls in sunspot activity can last several decades, driving down the sun's luminosity to a "grand minimum". The Maunder minimum lasted from 1645 to 1715 and may have contribute-d to the little ice age. Stefan Rahmstorf and Georg Feulner of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany modelled what would happen to temperatur-es on Earth if a grand minimum started now and lasted until 2100. They found that while temperatur-es would go down by as much as 0.3 C, global warming would push up temperatur-es by 3.7 to 4.5 C - more than negating any effect of a global minimum.

Kerr on 14 June 2011, 6:06 PM A 10-year prediction has the sun devoid of sunspots when it should be covered with them. Things may be about to get very dull on the sun. Three different measurements of solar activity, reported by scientists at a press conference today, suggest that the next 11-year-long solar cycle will be far quieter than the current one. In fact, it may not happen at all: Sunspots, the enormous magnetic storms that erupt on the sun's surface as the cycle builds, might disappear entirely for the first time in approximately 400 years. Taken together, the scientists say, the three trends suggest that no visible solar cycle will begin at the next expected start time, around 2020. Such a gap last happened during the Maunder Minimum 400 years ago. http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/20\\...

Prior studies by the USGS and other institutions attribute the decline to unusual springtime warming, more precipitation falling now as rain rather than snow and earlier snowmelt. The warming and snowpack decline are projected to worsen through the 21st century, foreshadowing a strain on water supplies. Runoff from winter snowpack -- layers of snow that accumulate at high altitude -- accounts for 60 to 80 percent of the annual water supply for more than 70 million people living in the western United States... "Over most of the 20th century, and especially since the 1980s, the northern Rockies have borne the brunt of the snowpack losses," said USGS scientist Gregory Pederson, the lead author of the study. "Most of the land and snow in the northern Rockies sits at lower and warmer elevations than the southern Rockies, making the snowpack more sensitive to seemingly small increases in temperature... Forest fires were larger, more frequent and harder to fight, while Glacier National Park lost 125 of its 150 glaciers." Loading comments... National Academy of Sciences, 2010 ----------------------------------------\\... What is Known about Climate Change Science has made enormous progress toward understanding climate change. As a result, there is a strong, credible body of evidence, based on multiple lines of research, documenting that Earth is warming. Strong evidence also indicates that recent warming is largely caused by human activities, especially the release of greenhouse gases through the burning of fossil fuels. Global warming is closely associated with other climate changes and impacts, including rising sea levels, increases in intense rainfall events, decreases in snow cover and sea ice, more frequent and intense heat waves, increases in wildfires, longer growing seasons, and ocean acidification. Individually and collectively, these changes pose risks for a wide range of human and environmental systems. While much remains to be learned, the core phenomenon, scientific questions, and hypotheses have been examined thoroughly and have stood firm in the face of serious scientific debate and careful evaluation of alternative explanations.
OP	Search Famous Australian Artist Charles 'Blackman' discriminated against It wouldn't be the first time a black man has been discriminated against but in this case he is white. A two year old filly called 'Blackman" has been blacklisted (irony not lost here)  by the Racing Information Services Australia (RISA), which controls the  registration and naming of racehorses, after it received one complaint. The Trainer David Hayes was informed "the name Blackman "could be construed as being offensive" and was forced to change the name to 'lady blackman'. The name 'Blackman' actually carries significant meaning. The horse is by a stallion called Excellent Art and as is often the case the foal is given a name that somehow relates to the stallion. When a name was being decided the Famous Australian Artist Charles Blackman was mentioned. Renowned for his 'Excellent Art', Blackman  is one of the best known Australian artists still living today notably for the Schoolgirl and Alice in Wonderland series of the 1950s. So the trainer and his staff decided that 'Blackman' would be a perfect name for the horse and a fitting tribute to Mr Blackman. That is until the RISA decided to act after a lone complaint was made to them about the name. Some in discriminant loser with little to no time on their hands decides to complain that the name of the horse is racially offensive.  Now instead of taking the complaint and filing it under 'loser' the RISA decided in their wisdom that the complaint was valid and the name needed to be changed. Even when they investigated the reason for the name they decided that 'without context' it could not be used. When I read this, shock bells started ringing . Because this man's name was 'Blackman' the horse could not be name after him. Isn't Mr Blackman being discriminated against? If they called the horse 'jones' or 'smith' I am sure that would have been acceptable. What if the horse was called 'whiteman'? Now don't get me wrong racism is destructive and should not be condoned but clearly in this case there isn't even a case to answer. Has society become so scared that  the opinion of one person can directly affect so many. Mr Blackman has been robbed of this honour because some ill directed freedom fighter forgot to take their medication. If I went by the name white, brown, black, grey I would be extremely worried that in the near future my name will be banned from being printed or published in fear offending someone. They will have to call Quentin Tarrantino for a rewrite  of 'Reservoir Dogs' in fear that the lead characters names have offended 100% of the population. Australia needs to have a good hard look at itself. We once reviled America for being too politically correct. Now America has a black man running the White House!                                         I don't want to live in a society where i fear that I am offending someone or where I have to constantly monitor what comes out of my mouth.                                                                                              What am I meant to do when I order a coffee or a tea from a cafe? 'can I please have a black coffee, oh shit sorry. A coffee with no milk. ' how would you like your tea?' 'white with one thanks. Oh no I am sorry, shit,  I meant to say, with milk and sugar' If we don't address this issue now then our society will be a very sad and intimidating place to live. Finally I would like to mention that there is a great Hotel in Richmond called 'The Blackman Hotel'. It has 670 digitally reproduced fine art prints from Charles Blackman. I wonder when this hotel will be closed because the name 'Blackman' is not used in context. Or maybe this hotel is for black people only.  Either way on my trip to Melbourne this weekend I will be dropping by to have a beer, admire and pay tribute to a great Australian artist. Just as an aside -- I was out to dinner as part of a group of Australians in NYC. At the end of the meal we ordered coffee -- a long black, two short blacks, and a flat white were part of that order. We got a five minute lecture from our waiter on how 'we weren't allowed to say things like that in the US' and how 'racist' that we were being. Needless to say we all laughed. Sad but true. If the name was a racial slur then absolutely it should be struck off the list -- however an intelligent and deeply meaningful name should be heralded as the way forward for a successful multi racial society. Poor form to the racing registry, shame on them. Happened on this web page by chance. Saw this thread & the poor emergency worker adolescent/virgin airlines one. Are all Aussies paranoid? do all of you have a inferiority complex? re: BLACKMAN, great idea to honor a person during their lifetime. However, hard to believe one would name a filly "Blackman", sounds screwy to me. Why not be clever & name the filly "BLACKMAN'S ARTISTE" or "BLACKMAN'S GAL". With the gentleman's approval, of course. Maybe being paranoid is a Commonwealth thing. Noticed it about Canadians 50 years ago. You people down under are great, no need to flex your muscles, or fight at the drop of a hat. G-DAY.
OP	I generally stay out of the whole Creationist argument (well, on my blog at least). Let me be clear -- I am an atheist.  Very staunchly so.  But other people write far better and far more cogently than I on the clash between creationism and science, and I'm quite happy to let them do so. So today's post will be a short one, and I will do my best to refrain from ranting. I am NOT, however, amused.  Not at all. Certainly, I've read the Bible, and I've heard about other Creationist texts and the scientific nonsense they espouse, but today I came across a textbook, currently being taught to 4th grade children , which set my teeth on edge. I think the book's called Science 4 (it's not made clear), but of far more importance is the explanation of subjects, including the moon and electricity, within. To quote the book on the subject of electricity: To be clear.  This is absolutely incorrect.  We know _ lots _ about electricity.  Many, many books have been written about it. Much of our current technology would not be possible without our understanding it.  If you want to read a more detailed rebuttal, have a look here , for a start. On the subject of the moon (you can read the entire chapter here , but beware, your jaw may permanently unhinge): click to enlarge Once again, not true.  While there remains debate, the current favourite hypothesis is that a giant impact explains the moon's origin. Certainly, of the debate surrounding the moon's origins, the 'God created it' hypothesis is seldom held out as a valid one. My point, for both examples, is that there's a tonne of information which directly puts the lie to the flagrant lies being told by this textbook.  The problem?  I'm not sure the children being taught this will find that out in time. Which is what really upsets me. I'm not particularly interested in which deities people believe in, or their personal beliefs.  I become upset, however, when not only are people holding desperately onto their ignorance (which really does matter when it comes to the public influencing their politicians) but, even worse, passing it on to their children. Children with this poor an understanding of how things really work are unlikely to do very well in the work force, especially against competitors who _are_ decently educated.  Nor are they likely to, through their votes, get their governments to make sane policy decisions. Reading creationist homeschooling material is hardly to be reccommended, except possibly for humour purposes. As I understand it in the US there are no restrictions where it comes to teaching creationism in \homeschool\, where that term is used rather loosely. But this /is/ rather a...potent example :D "A number of people have taken the opportunity to ridicule the science that is presented here as well as the Bible. The basic point being made is that Christians are just out of it; we don_Tt have a clue; we are _otwo hundred years__ out of touch with reality. Are Christians just out of it, scientifically speaking? The answer comes down to viewpoint. If you believe that man can know everything and that science is the path to that knowledge, then you would say yes; Christians are befuddled. If, however, you believe that man_Ts study of the universe is limited by his senses even when those senses are extended through technology, then your answer is no; Christians are clearly not _oout of it.__ " Actually, there are plenty of Christians who are intelligent and accept (and understand) science. They should really be more specific rather than imply all Christians are like this. Speaking of appalling drivel, this from the Immunisation Awareness Society's website on 11 August 2011. They are MORONS. "So now we have an outbreak of Rubella. This of course doesn_Tt surprise me at all with parents rushing off to vaccinate their children with the live virus MMR vaccine and then sending them straight back out into the community to mix with other people whilst still shedding the 3 live vaccine viruses, I have no doubt there will be plenty of mumps out there in the not too distant future (if not already) and this too will be classed as a _orare__ illness when in fact it isn_Tt all that rare at all, just as I_Tm quite sure Rubella isn_Tt actually all that rare, it_Ts just such a mild illness many parents wouldn_Tt even know their children have it_" wait, so they're now claiming that outbreaks are _caused_ by vaccinations, rather than preventing them? gosh... carol 427 days ago Truly they are cretins. The Ministry of Health advisory on the outbreak quite clearly said that most of those who have come down with measles are unvaccinated schoolchildren.

SP	What the CIA director's decision means and whether it could impact the Benghazi terror probe Transcript: REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Good evening. How are you? VAN SUSTEREN: I'm very well. Congressman, the affair -- I mean, for the most part, it's -- I mean, it's sort of -- I'm trying to separate this out. It really is a matter for General Petraeus and his wife. But there is -- there are some parts of it that do have sort of an implication. One is whether or not it's a security breach and that it should have been picked up and turned over to the House intel committees and whether or not that could ever be used as blackmail against him. Your thought, sir. GOWDY: Well, even someone as lowly as an assistant U.S. attorney has to undergo a background check, and you're asked a series of very invasive questions, and you're expected to tell the truth and they're under penalty of perjury. And you're asked those questions so you can't be blackmailed or extorted. So you can increase that by an exponential factor when you're talking about the head of the CIA. So I would expect Mike Rogers would have liked to have known that information and he would have liked to have known it in a timely fashion. But I'll tell you this, Greta. The fact -- and I do lament the personal ramifications, but the fact that he's resigned and had an affair has nothing to do with whether or not he's going to be subpoenaed to Congress. I hope we don't have to subpoena a four-star general and a former CIA director. I hope he would come voluntarily. But if he won't, he will be subpoenaed. And none of what has happened today is a defense to a subpoena. VAN SUSTEREN: All right, would you agree that there is no sort of security problem, or even a blackmail problem, if for instance, his wife knew about it and he had told the FBI or the CIA, whoever conducted it, so that he was not in any way sort of vulnerable to any sort of outside someone coming in trying to influence him? Would you agree to that? GOWDY: It could be. I mean, that's a very fact-intensive inquiry. It may be that his wife knew, but his mother didn't. It may be that his wife knew but his kids didn't. And I suspect that with men like General Petraeus, where honor means something -- losing your life is secondary to losing your honor. So the fact that your wife knows something doesn't necessarily get you off the hook in terms of losing your honor. VAN SUSTEREN: All right. Now, getting back to Benghazi. Is he an essential part of this inquiry? I mean, I've just read a timeline -- I do have trouble with the fact that his -- I mean, I don't know what happened between the time the CIA station chief in Libya said that it was essentially a terrorism group, a terrorist or a militant group, and the time he went to Capitol Hill. I don't know where in the world this video came up with (ph). But do you expect that he will testify and explain that? GOWDY: He's going to have to. He's either a witness in our case in chief, or he's going to be a rebuttal witness after Susan Rice and others blame him for their failure of intelligence and failure of information. So to put it back in a courtroom, he's either going to be one of our witnesses in our case in chief or we're going to wait until someone else invokes his name or blames him, and then he'll be a rebuttal witness. But there's no way we can get to the bottom of Benghazi without David Petraeus. So while he may not be around next week because he's got personal matters, the week after that and the week after that and the week after that, this excuse will run stale. VAN SUSTEREN: Well, the unanswered question tonight is what provoked the resignation, or what provoked -- I mean, was someone going public with it? Was -- you know, was there a problem? Or was it Benghazi and he didn't want to testify? I mean, we don't know tonight what sort of provoked the confession which then resulted in the resignation. It's, like, that's -- that's sort of -- that's also a missing piece of information tonight. GOWDY: Well, the questions are a lot better than the answers, at this point. But as your previous guests were talking, I thought about a book by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, "Crime and Punishment." Sometimes it's just guilt. There's no other explanation bigger than guilt. I don't know David Petraeus. I sat beside him at a dinner one time, but I hardly -- I hardly know him. I don't know what the motivation was. I do know this. We'll find it out. Benghazi's not going anywhere, despite the fact that most of the members of the so-called mainstream media have ignored it so far. In a perverse way, the fact that we now have a salacious component to it is going to mean that they're guaranteed to cover it. So we're going to find out what happened to those four murdered Americans one way or another. VAN SUSTEREN: Well, I think that, at least most of the people I talk to would really like to know, and it's gotten, you know, more bizarre as the days have marched on, with the different stories, incomplete information, and all the information will be probably greatly appreciated. Congressman, thank you, sir.
NA IN	From the Desk of Billy Buskell: Creating Leviathan The team in Edmonton started work on the Leviathan pack just shortly after launching Mass Effect 3 in March of this year. We all took quick vacation breaks between completing the main game and jumping into the thick of DLC creation to get recharged and refocused. Throughout the final year of development on Mass Effect 3, the team had started to think of some additional stories we hoped to tell. We wanted to tell a story that would help tell the player more about Shepard's background and that would help tie up threads within the Mass Effect universe. The idea to go back and explore more about a fabled "genetically engineered starship," an urban legend within the franchise, was incredibly tempting. The Leviathan of Dis was only hinted at in the first Mass Effect game, but it had caught the attention of several fans, even leading to several theories and fan-fic about what it was and what it meant to the overall universe. Because of the mysterious nature of the Leviathan, the team also started to think of how we could craft that mystery in the game. How could we have the player solve a mystery? We wanted the player to do the solving for themselves. This led to the idea of finding clues within the pack and that these threads would then lead the player to a central location where they could piece the puzzle back together, knowing there may always be more pieces to discover. In Leviathan, we give the players a brand new way to locate clues throughout their journey and to use those clues in a new in-game system to help track down new locations to visit. This led to our next goal. Exploration was going to be a major part of Leviathan. In any BioWare game, there is exploration, but we wanted to take this idea even further in Leviathan. Exploration has typically meant creating additional space in a location or environment where the player can spend some time, find some cool loot, learn more about the story and universe, and trigger new quests within the larger story. For Leviathan, exploration meant adding more of this but also having a variety of diverse locations to travel to, and those locations would then present new areas to explore: everything from searching through facilities, vertical movement throughout a level and combat, and, for the first time in the Mass Effect series, controlling your movement in an underwater environment. Leviathan will also introduce new weapons previously only available in our co-op multiplayer mode or through pre-order bonuses. So, as you can see, the team has been very busy this year. We hope you enjoy playing Mass Effect 3: Leviathan, and we look forward to your feedback.

AWS isn't the only provider whose cloud can run Microsoft's new server operating system. The OS can already be installed on Microsoft's own Azure cloud and Rackspace also offers a number of different configurations on its platform. The operating system is available in AWS data centers around the world, and enterprises can choose between 31 Windows Server 2012 virtual images. They support 19 different languages and have been prepackaged with SQL Server 2008 and 2008 R2, Tom Rizzo, general manager for the Windows team at AWS, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. Windows Server 2012 became generally available in September, and includes the Internet Information Services (IIS) 8.0 web server, version 4.5 of the .Net framework and improved management using PowerShell. With Windows PowerShell 3.0 administrators can for the first time handle any management task using the command line interface, and in the process save time by automating more and more tasks, according to Microsoft. Enterprises can also use Windows Server 2012 with Elastic Beanstalk, which AWS is pitching as an easier way to deploy and manage applications. Developers upload their ASP.NET applications to the AWS cloud, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically takes care of deployment details such as capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling and application health monitoring, according to the company. Elastic Beanstalk is still being beta tested. Windows Server 2012 is also included in the so-called free tier of AWS services, which allows new customers to run the OS and other services for free for up to a year. Enterprises can start evaluating Windows Server 2012 and then move to a production environment when they are ready, according to Rizzo. Running Windows Server on the AWS cloud costs from US$0.02 per hour with the company's on-demand pricing. Previously, AWS users could choose between Windows Server 2003 R2, 2008 and 2008 R2. They are still available alongside Windows Server 2012. Entrada had this on the 2012 launch This has been running in the Entrada Datacentre since 2012 launch date.

NA	EDUCATION Microsoft Pushes Plan to Pay for STEM Education With H-1B Visa Fees Microsoft, the nation's top employer of H-1B workers, has proposed a plan linking education with visa fees as a possible way to ease its problems infinding qualified workers to fill open jobs as researchers, engineers, and developers. Microsoft is looking to drum up support for an ambitious plan to link immigration reform with increased funding for science education by charging technology companies for access to a new pool of 20,000 H-1B visas for foreign nationals with expertise in STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said he hoped the plan could pass Congress in 2013. "The country has about a year to see Congress take some important steps," Smith told reporters Thursday.  "If we don't see steps over the next year, I think we should all worry about the future of these jobs in the United States." Microsoft is the leading U.S. employer of workers on H-1B visas, and the company says it's having trouble finding qualified workers to fill open jobs as researchers, engineers, and developers, with more than 6,000 unfilled positions. The company hopes that the promise of an additional $200 million in potential education funding per year generated by $10,000 per-visa fees will motivate Congress to look past partisan squabbles over immigration reform and pass a bill that targets the highly skilled workers that are in demand by U.S. companies. The fee is "sizable by design,"  according to a Microsoft document outlining the plan. "It is large enough to represent a material commitment to building America's STEM pipeline." On the education reform side, Microsoft wants to see more computer science curriculum in high schools, improved teacher training in K-12 STEM teachers, and promote ways of getting college students who begin programs in STEM disciplines to graduate. In addition to Microsoft, Intel, IBM, Oracle, and Google are leading requestors of H-1B workers, according to the Department of Labor. Despite an industry-wide push for changes to the H-1B visa program, Microsoft is rolling out this plan alone, in a presentation Thursday at the Brookings Institute. Microsoft's Smith said he hopes he can "spark a conversation that brings more people to the table." He discussed immigration reform with senior Democrats and Republicans at the party conventions, and said that people from other leading technology companies reported similar gaps between job openings and qualified workers. "We want to work in close partnership with companies and industry groups," Smith said. "And put our voice behind this and see if we can't get something done over the next year." "I think the politics can work on this," said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation and a backer of immigration reform for highly skilled workers. "I don't think either party is going to get kudos for what they failed to do a few weeks ago on visa reform. I think they're going to be more sensitive to getting something done after the election. This is a pretty easy slam-dunk for them, particularly if other companies come out for it." A bipartisan deal to reform immigration rules for highly skilled workers fell apart in Congress last week over whether visa recipients would be able to bring along their families. Sen. Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y., and Rep. Lamar Smith , R-Texas, who heads the Judiciary Committee in the House, had teamed up on a bid for an increase of 55,000 in the number of visas available to foreign-born graduates of American universities with degrees in a STEM discipline. Both Schumer and Smith introduced separate legislation last week. Rep. Smith is due to relinquish his post atop the Judiciary Committee, and is expected to be replaced by Rep. Bob Goodlatte , R-Va., who has been active on technology issues and is a co-sponsor of Smith's bill. Microsoft's plan focuses narrowly on the H-1B visa. Current law permits 65,000 immigrants to enter on  H1-B visas annually, with an additional 20,000 visas issued to foreign-born graduates of U.S. universities. The plan, with its $10,000 fees, seems tailor made for a large company like Microsoft with urgent needs to fill jobs. However, Smith says that starting salaries for engineers across the industry are comparable at big and small companies, with the "fully burdened cost" of a recent graduate in engineering averaging about $200,000, including salary, benefits, and overhead. "Most companies would find this an attractive investment to make," compared with leaving jobs unfilled, Smith said. "Using immigration to raise money provides a new path forward. Will this be the key that unlocks the door? No one knows." WORKFORCE POLITICS Education Leave a Comment Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

NA	share this story Last week, the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission met to hear recommendations about the future of America's nuclear plants after Japan's nuclear crisis. The nuclear industry, which just a year ago had been wildly optimistic about the prospects for a "nuclear renaissance," is now hobbled by concerns over the health, safety and financial ramifications of the ongoing nuclear disaster at Fukushima. After being told for decades that nuclear power is safe, reliable, clean and cheap, it's worth carefully considering how the fantasy of a nuclear dream gave way to the reality of a nuclear nightmare. The most recent reminder of that terrible reality came when an earthquake and tsunami overwhelmed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan, causing fires, explosions, and three complete core meltdowns. 770,000 terabecquerels of radiation were released in just the first few days of the crisis, equivalent to 40 percent of the total radiation released from Chernobyl. Further consequences remain to be seen, as plant operators are still struggling to bring the reactors to a complete shutdown and contain radioactive material, but alarms are already being raised about high radiation levels at elementary schools dozens of miles away. Tens of thousands of evacuees will likely never return to their homes, and radiation spread around Japan and the surrounding ocean is causing major food and health concerns . The public had previously been roused from its nuclear fantasy when a routine safety check gone wrong at the Chernobyl power plant led to the worst nuclear disaster to date, forcing a quarter million people to permanently evacuate their homes and leaving thousands to struggle with the tragic legacy of cancer as the result of high radiation exposures. Twenty-five years after the disaster, the Chernobyl nuclear reactors lie inside a shaky and structurally unsound concrete sarcophagus at the center of the Exclusion Zone, awaiting the day hundreds or thousands of years from now when the dangerously irradiated area will be safely habitable once more. And more than thirty years ago, mechanical and human errors woke the public from a pro-nuke slumber when they caused a partial core meltdown in a reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, forcing 140,000 people to evacuate and initiating a cleanup that took 12 years and cost $973 million . Each of these tragic disasters is a poignant reminder of just how dangerous nuclear power truly is. And there are more minor incidents as well, the risks that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission willfully accommodates by rewriting safety precautions and relaxing regulations : cracked tubing, corroded pipes, broken nozzles, rust, and more. Not only could these factors cripple a reactor in the event of an emergency, but an Associated Press investigation uncovered leaks of radioactive tritium at 48 of 65 sites, with some leaks at hundreds of times the allowable Environmental Protection Agency standard. Among those leaky reactors is the Palisades Power Plant in Kalamazoo, Michigan, which reported tritium levels above the EPA standard in 2007 and again in 2009 . I can see the steam plume of the Palisades plant from the backyard of my father's farm; now I worry that my family might drink irradiated water from that same reactor. Plutonium-239 has a half life of 24,000 years , but the human memory operates on a far shorter span. As recent tragedies become more distant, it is too easy to fall back on false illusions, even if they are haunted by the ever-present specter of another possible nuclear disaster. If the public is lulled back into the nuclear fantasy of "safe, reliable, clean and cheap," what will be next? A disaster at the Fort Calhoun nuclear plant in Nebraska, surrounded by Missouri floodwater? Meltdowns at the Diablo Canyon or San Onofre nuclear plants in California, both located near a major fault line and the Pacific Coast? Questions and headaches for the nuclear industry It is past time to wake up and face the hard truths of this recurring nuclear nightmare. After the Fukushima Daiichi disaster, the nuclear industry is struggling against stiff headwinds in the United States as both old reactors and proposed new reactors around the country meet growing opposition. A case in point: the recently failed proposal to construct new nuclear reactors in Iowa. In order to pay for the new reactors, MidAmerican Energy wanted legislation that would raise electricity rates. MidAmerican would have kept the money even if it never followed through on actually building the reactors. It was a shoddy deal for ordinary Iowans, and yet the proposal attracted little attention, sailed through committee consideration, and was expected to easily pass the state legislature. After the Fukushima crisis, things began to change. Just as national support for the construction of new nuclear reactors dropped , Iowans expressed their strong opposition to the MidAmerican proposal, with 75 percent against the bill. Friends of the Earth helped mobilize public sentiment by running print and television ads criticizing the bill and encouraging Iowans to express their concerns to the state legislature. Not surprisingly, state legislators started having doubts as well. "We got the details and realized that the rate payers really have to have all the risk in this thing," said State Senator Bill Dotzler (D-Waterloo). Despite MidAmerican's extensive lobbying, the Iowa state legislature adjourned on July 1 without passing the bill, a major setback for the bill's supporters. This is just one setback among many. Various proposed nuclear plants in Texas have been scrapped, mainly for financial reasons. Exelon withdrew plans to construct a twin-unit nuclear plant in Victoria County, Texas in order to focus on wind energy instead. After ground was broken for new nuclear reactors in Georgia and South Carolina, construction prospects were impeded by serious questions about the safety of the Westinghouse AP1000 reactors to be built at those sites. Although the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had previously been expected to approve the reactors by the end of summer, significant delays are likely after flawed calculations in Westinghouse's submission "led to more questions," according to NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko . Existing reactors are facing challenges as well. The Vermont legislature voted 26-4 to shut down the aged Vermont Yankee nuclear plant, which contains a reactor similar in design to the Fukushima Daiichi reactors, although the decision is being disputed by a lawsuit from the plant's operator, Entergy. And Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York recently reaffirmed his intentions to shut down the Indian Point nuclear plant , less than 30 miles from New York City. Real problems need real solutions Nuclear power currently supplies 19 percent of all electricity in the United States. Nuclear advocates argue that nuclear is preferable to fossil fuels, but this is a dangerous and misleading argument. There are better options, like renewable energy and increases in energy efficiency. The challenges for the nuclear industry are even steeper elsewhere. Germany, led by the conservative Angela Merkel, has published a plan to invest heavily in renewable energy and close all of its nuclear reactors by 2017 - without the construction of new coal plants or significant rate hikes. Similarly, Switzerland has pledged to phase out its nuclear reactors by 2034 and make up the difference entirely in renewable energy. Even though nuclear power is currently the source for 30 percent of Japan's energy, Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan has expressed support for a complete nuclear phase-out . Already, 35 of Japan's 54 nuclear plants have halted operations in the wake of the Fukushima crisis, and "setsuden" conservation measures aim to make up the difference by reducing energy consumption by 15 percent this summer. Furthermore, billionaire Japanese businessman Masayoshi Son has unveiled plans to build solar farms around the country, which would triple Japan's use of renewable energy to 30 percent of the nation's total by 2020. Altogether, these efforts demonstrate that with innovation and political willpower, an end to nuclear energy is not only possible, but entirely feasible. The idea that nuclear energy could be a safe solution to the world's energy needs was never more than an empty dream. Clearly, nuclear is just another nightmare problem. It's time to wake up to that awful reality and start focusing on better answers. Loading comments...

As a point of perspective, 770,000 terabequerels of radiation is equivalent to...a couple thousand freighter loads of bananas. Seriously. The natural radiation of a banana is about 15 bequerels due to its potassium content, there's roughly one hundred bananas per crate, fifty crates to a pallet, and a typical freighter load is about five thousand pallets.

Hope he will allow some folks like US to be part of that selection group! Of course Richard Branson advocates nuclear energy on a scale similar to France's. Another thing is, what I strongly feel when I'm doing the decontamination work in Fukushima is that emergency decontamination and permanent decontamination should be dealt with separately. We've been doing a lot of emergency decontamination work. For example, if you look at this diagram, you will notice that the bottom of this slide is where small children put their hands on. ,,, We should do more emergency decontamination work . The ground right under the roof gutter is also where children frequently put their hands on. If you use high pressure washer you can reduce the radiation level from 2 microsieverts to 0.5 microsievert. However, it is extremely difficult to lower the level to less than 0.5microsievert, because everything is contaminated. Buildings, trees, whole areas. You can lower radiation dose of one place, but very difficult to do that for the whole area. Then, how much will it cost when you seriously do the decontamination work? In case of "Itai-Itai Disease" caused by cadmium poisoning, to decontaminate half of cadmium-contaminated area of roughly 3,000 hectare, the government has spent 800 billion yen so far. How much money will be needed if we have to decontaminate the area 1,000 times as big? Loading comments...

As a result of this, Mabus told the Times, "Within 10 years, the United States Navy will get one half of all its energy needs, both afloat and onshore, from non-fossil fuel sources. America and the Navy rely too much on fossil fuels. It makes the military, in this case our Navy and Marine Corps, far too vulnerable to some sort of disruption."

IN	If a Prime Minister loses the support from his party's back-benchers, his position becomes very weak. This happened to both Margaret Thatcher and John Major. In one speech made in the House of Commons, Geoffrey Howe, a former Cabinet colleague of Thatcher's, started the process that lead to an effective revolt against her style of leadership and her ultimate resignation as Prime Minister in 1990. John Major also experienced a revolt over his support for Britain developing greater links with Europe . He is alleged to have referred to those Cabinet colleagues who did not support his stance on Europe as "bastards". By 1997 , when Major called a general election , the party was in such disarray that in suffered in biggest electoral defeat in recent history. The Labour Party has a vast Parliamentary majority and has the knowledge that they can push through Parliament policies promised at the 2001 election with relative ease. However, Blair has to respect that his position as party leader is dependent on maintaining support amongst the Labour MP back-benchers. If he loses this, he will lose the authority required by a party leader and his hopes of leading the party without the support of that party will be minimal. As Prime Minister , such a position would be untenable. Those back-benchers who fail to support his style of leadership could put up a 'stalking horse' candidate in an election contest for party leadership. Though Blair would win this contest (probably with some ease) it would be damaging for the party as the start of any rebellion might prove difficult to contain and it might gain an unstoppable momentum. An authoritative leadership of the party is a vital component for a Prime Minister to be successful and a Prime Minister would always keep a close eye on what is said by his party's back-bench MP's. Another factor that limits a Prime Minister's power is the fact that he is seen to be publicly responsible for any major mishap that occurs during his time in power. The American President, Richard Nixon had a plaque on his desk which stated "the buck stops here". As the Prime Minister is the person in charge, the buck stops with him. When things go well, the Prime Minister can bath in the glory but the opposite is also true. As the most known member of the government, it is he that the public hold to be accountable when things go wrong. Anthony Eden was held responsible for the Suez episode in 1956; Edward Heath was seen as the person responsible for the 1974 miners strike when a three-day working week was introduced; Margaret Thatcher was held responsible for the problems associated with the Poll Tax etc. Tony Blair has been accused of being too friendly with America's President Bush and not being critical enough of the President's foreign policy designs. If an attack on Iraq occurs and Britain is involved, a success will greatly benefit the Prime Minister's position, whereas a perceived failure may well weaken his position so that a 'stalking horse' candidate for a challenge to Blair's leadership of the party may well take on momentum. The potential for a revolt in the Cabinet - though historically rare - is another limitation on a Prime Minister. Membership of the Cabinet depends on the Prime Minister and it would be rare for a politician to 'bite the hand that feeds him'. However, John Major did experience trouble with his Cabinet and Tony Blair has been accused of by-passing his Cabinet for the sake of a 'kitchen cabinet' and the advice of "special advisors". The political relationship he has with his chancellor, Gordon Brown, has been dissected by the media and Blair will be aware that it was a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Geoffrey Howe, who started the downfall of Margaret Thatcher. The House of Lords can politically limit what the Prime Minister pushes through via the Commons. However, with the Lords in a state of flux at present, it is difficult to assess to what extent the new version of the Lords will be able to limit the power of the government. The European Commission certainly has the power the part-shape government policy by imposing on member states policies that may not have been stated in the Labour Party's election manifesto in 2001. Two recent examples of the power of the European Union over the government are: to protect the environment, all old fridges now have to be disposed of properly and cannot be 're-cycled' i.e. given to a new owner via a charity shop etc. Britain now faces the embarrassment of a 'fridge mountain' which may be disposed of by exporting them to France for proper re-cycling. This correct disposal of fridges will shortly be extended to all electrical goods throughout the Union. The Prime Minister can do nothing about this as Britain signed up to the European Union and in 1972 put European Law above British law with the signing of the European Communities Act which was upheld by the Lords in 1991 with the Factortame Case. In August 2002, the Commission has stated that it wants Britain brought into line with the rest of the EU member states over cyclists. In the EU any car driver involved in a crash with a cyclist is automatically held responsible regardless of the part played by the cyclist. It has been estimated by insurers, that this will increase the annual cost of insuring a car in Britain by 50 to cover legal cases involving cars and cyclists. Again, the Prime Minister will be able to do little over this even though it is likely to prove les than popular. A Prime Minister may also feel it necessary to respond to a pressure group . In 1997 , many people felt that the Labour Party made its position clear on fox hunting - that it could not be tolerated in a civilised society. Having won the 1997 election, it was believed that legal steps would be taken to outlaw fox hunting. That lead to the creation of the Countryside Alliance which is a well funded pressure group dedicated to the maintenance of a traditional country life which includes the right to hunt foxes. At present, in August 2002, fox hunting is still legal and the arguments have got bogged down into allowing licensed hunts, a free Commons vote etc. The Countryside Alliance has already organised one very large demonstration in London and has organised another for September 2002. No Prime Minister would admit that their policies are shaped by un-elected pressure groups but it is clear that in this case, the impact of the Countryside Alliance has been marked. Though the Prime Minister has a great deal of political power, this power is also balanced by the fact that there are limitations to that power. While a Prime Minister has the backing of his party, his position is secure; if he loses that support, then his position becomes very vulnerable. Any Prime Minister would always ensure that he knows what the opinions of the back-benchers are.
NA	How to... make it big in showbusiness For the past 40 years, the legend 'Harvey Goldsmith Presents...' has been synonymous with spectacular music events. But Goldsmith prefers to think of himself as something more than a mere rock promoter. While a pharmacy student at Brighton College, he was elected social secretary and he booked bands such as the Move and the Moody Blues. After a spell selling rock posters throughout Europe, he became a full-time music promoter in 1971. Throughout the Seventies and Eighties, he averaged 500 concerts a year and has worked with the Rolling Stones, Neil Young, Queen, Madonna and Pink Floyd. He is most famous for orchestrating 1985's Live Aid, 2005's Live 8 and 2007's Live Earth. Despite seeing his company succumb to bankruptcy in 1999, he has continued to embrace fresh business challenges. After producing shows by Pavarotti and the Three Tenors, he launched hugely successful tours of Carmen and Tosca, and last year set up Led Zeppelin's much-anticipated reunion concert. He recently organised the first rock concerts at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium -- two nights with Bruce Springsteen -- and is now producing a tour by Robert Plant and Alison Krauss. Goldsmith, 62, lives with his wife Diana in London. In 1996, he was awarded a CBE for services to music -- so who better to give advice to the budding impresario? Be firm but fair I used to have horrific rows with the management of Earls Court, who were the most obstinate people on the planet. I once went for an Italian meal with them and they were being even more difficult than ever. In a blind rage, I stood up and tipped over the table. There was spaghetti sauce everywhere, most of it over their expensive suits. Oddly enough, they agreed to my terms after that. I still lose my rag from time to time and you really don't want to see me in a temper. I only do it when I've run out of all other ways of getting my point across. Queen on stage in 1995 Nothing is too bizarre for rock stars I'd consider myself an expert on meeting the strange demands of rock bands. On one tour rider, Queen demanded a mud-wrestling ring outside the dressing-room to provide them with some after-show entertainment. I even sorted out the mud wrestlers. Alice Cooper did a show in Glasgow and told me to book a very warm room in his hotel. I assumed it was for a member of his band who didn't care too much for the British weather, but I should have realised that something was up when I learned the room was booked for a 'Mr Snake'. When we were checking the band into the hotel, the receptionist enquired when Mr Snake would be arriving. Someone opened up a case and this bloody great python slithered out. The receptionist fainted on the spot. And while I've had some mad times with rock stars, the Who's Keith Moon was in a league of his own. I was with him the first time he threw a TV out of a hotel window. He'd convinced himself that if he dropped a TV and a feather from the fifth floor, they'd hit the ground at the same time. The feather landed all right but the TV set didn't look too clever. There was nothing Moonie wouldn't do for a laugh. Always be contactable The nature of my job means I hardly ever get a decent night's sleep. I'm in the service business and need to be on call constantly. If the phone rings in the middle of the night, I need to answer it in case some extraordinary problem has arisen. In the past there were times when I'd survive on two hours' sleep a night. Now I average about six. Most days I'll get between 150 to 200 emails, all of them work-related. Even in the days before mobile phones and laptops, people always found a way of getting hold of me. I once went on holiday to Spain and was lying on the beach when I noticed this man in a pinstripe suit wandering up and down the sand. He'd been looking for me for three days to let me know that someone wanted to buy my company. I had to get dressed pretty sharpish and find a phone box. Let people decide their own fate It might come as a surprise but I very rarely sack people. It's obvious if someone can't cope in a job and more often than not they'll walk away of their own volition. Few people want the pressure of being in a job they can't handle. Don't become obsessed with money The difference between me and billionaire entrepreneurs like Richard Branson is that I'm not an animal. I've always wanted financial security and I'm glad I've got it. But having enough has always been OK with me. I don't need ten or 20 times that amount. People like Branson are different. Everything is set aside in pursuit of more money. It's like a disease, a complete obsession. As soon as they get in the Top 100 richest, they want to be in the Top 10 and they won't stop even when they're the richest in the world. I'm not built like that. I have a hard side and a soft side. It means I'm worth millions rather than billions but I wouldn't want it any other way. Learn from your failures Bankruptcy is one of the best things that ever happened to me. My company started getting into trouble in the mid-Nineties when we were building up an entertainment conglomerate and expanding too fast. We'd had a big success with the movie Lawnmower Man and committed ourselves to a sequel. It started going wrong when Pierce Brosnan dropped out to play James Bond and it never recovered. Every penny I was earning was being sucked into the project. Basically, I took my eye off the ball. I was out on the road with various tours and lost control of the core structure of the company. Without that strong core, any business is going to run into trouble. The company went bankrupt in 1999 and by that time I'd lost a fortune in attempting to prop it up. I became very depressed but looking back it was a blessing. After the shock of bankruptcy, I was forced to take stock of my life and became a lot choosier in terms of what I took on. And it taught me that business was only a part of my life. I also had friends and family and needed to spend more time with them. I'm a lot happier now. My life feels a great deal more balanced. Get your problems into the open The golden rule of running a successful business is to get everyone to understand that everything has to be out in the open. My mission is simple: I want to solve a problem as quickly as possible. Solving problems is a lot easier than hiding them. When people are scared to bring up an issue, that's when things go terribly wrong. I am a combination of tough businessman and good teacher. Proof of that is that half the people in the live side of the entertainment business in this country used to work for me. I'm proud of that fact, even though it irks me when former employees end up in direct competition with me. There is no such a thing as mission impossible The hardest job I've ever had was managing Van Morrison. One time he was living in America and decided he wanted to come back to England to live. I suddenly got a postcard from him with a drawing of a house in Kensington. This was the house he wanted me to find for him to rent. By sheer coincidence I happened to drive past the very same house a few days later. I banged on the door and this little old lady answered. Amazingly, she was about to visit her grandkids in Australia and wanted to rent out the house. So I rang up Van and told him I'd rented the place for three months. He said he was coming over on the next plane. I met him at the airport and we drove straight there. 'That's definitely the one,' he said. He walked inside and came straight out again. 'This house has got bad karma,' he said. 'I can't stay here. Take me back to the airport.' And he flew straight back to Los Angeles on the same plane he'd arrived on. Success can be a curse Organising Live Aid was my greatest achievement but it helped kill rock 'n' roll. After Live Aid, rock music became part of the establishment. Everything became more mainstream and music lost a lot of its character. I preferred it when rock 'n' roll was in the margins and anti-establishment. I suppose I'm partly to blame for the way it's gone. Don't stop dreaming In 1978, I put on Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton at the Blackbushe Aerodrome in front of 175,000 people. I made something like 1 million out of the day. I could never have hoped for such a success, but I went for it. Now I want to persuade Led Zeppelin to do a world tour. It would be the biggest thing ever, even more than a Pink Floyd tour. I can't see Zep doing it in the way the Stones or the Police have done it; they've got nothing to prove either to themselves or anybody else. Big artists go on the road for two reasons -- either for the bank manager or for the wife or girlfriend. And Zep don't have either problem. But it won't stop me trying.
IN	If this was your reaction to the feature list when Reason 4 was announced, you were not alone (I have my hand up too). Over a year after Reason 4 was released, the ReGroove mixer still has many scratching their heads and thinking, well, why? New Groove What the Props have done with the ReGroove mixer is completely re-think the way you apply timing and dynamic variation to MIDI sequences. All respectable DAWs have ways to quantise MIDI notes (and audio notes in some cases, such as Pro Tools) to the grid or to groove templates. They also usually allow you to offset the timing of MIDI tracks, so that notes are shifted earlier or later, resulting in performances that are ahead of or behind the beat. These operations are traditionally treated as editing tasks -- that is, you select notes or a track and apply settings. These edits may not be destructive but are generally something that you will set and then leave alone afterwards. What Reason 4 attempts to do is make adjusting the 'feel' of a performance a real-time, mixing-stle task.The ReGroove mixer allows you to apply varying amounts of groove quantisation, shuffle, offset, randomness and velocity variation to individual tracks or note lanes. You can add different types of groove to each track, or use the same type and vary the amount and blend of timing and dynamics. The beauty of it is that it all happens in real time, and you use faders to adjust the amount by which each track is affected, allowing you to tweak multiple tracks by ear until they sit just right with each other. Getting Into The Swing Let's look at an example to get a feel for how the ReGroove mixer works. The main picture shows a Reason song with a Redrum drum machine and two Dr REX loop players. The drum machine is being triggered from the main sequencer (rather than its built-in step sequencer), and instead of using a single note lane to record the pattern, separate note lanes have been created to record the kick, snare, and hi-hat sequences. Taking this step allows each drum part to be groove-adjusted independently. In the sequencer (fourth down in the Reason rack, overleaf), you can see that each note lane has a pop-up menu between its record-ready button and Mute button. This is where you assign each lane to one of ReGroove's 32 channels. The hi-hats lane, for example, is assigned to A3, so it will be adjusted in real-time by whatever is going on in the third channel of ReGroove's 'A' bank. This song has a hi-hat pattern comprising 16 consecutive 16th notes, as you can see in the screen above A simple 16 step hi-hat run can be transformed into countless different rhythms. A simple 16 step hi-hat run can be transformed into countless different rhythms. . This is an ideal pattern to use for experimenting with ReGroove, as it reveals all the effects of any groove template and shuffle settings. You will, in fact, be astonished by how many different rhythms and feels you can generate from even this most basic of starting points. In the screen on the previous page the display in ReGroove's A3 channel is showing that a groove template called 'Erika' has been loaded from the factory presets . The channel's fader determines the impact of this template on the assigned MIDI lane and the template affects timing, velocity, and note length. As well as setting the overall amount of these three effects with the fader, you can adjust them relative to one another. This is achieved in the Groove page of the Tool Window, opened by clicking the Edit button at the top of the ReGroove channel, as shown in the screen at the top of the next page The mix of timing and dynamics from a template is set in the Tool Window. The mix of timing and dynamics from a template is set in the Tool Window. . In this case, I'm only adding a subtle timing change, and mainly using the veloctity variations inherent in the template. Shuffle & Slide Two knobs on each channel -- Slide and Shuffle -- operate in addition to the groove template, and are unaffacted by the fader position. Slide shifts notes earlier or later in time with respect to other tracks, allowing you to create a more 'rushed' or laid-back feel respectively. Shuffle adds a 16th-note swing, moving every other 16th note's position within each measure. At the central, 50 percent position, no shuffle is applied. Turning the knob clockwise yields a traditional 16th swing, with the 66 percent setting pushing the even numbered 16ths to triplet positions. Working in conjunction with all the channel settings is a Pre Align button, which hard quantises all notes to the grid prior to treatment by the Groove, Slide and Shuffle controls. This can be useful if you want to hear the true effect of the groove template, but you can leave it off to keep a flavour of your original recorded performance. Doctoring Your Groove Even if you work primarily with loops in Reason, you can still enjoy the benefits of ReGroove. The Dr REX loop player uses ReCycled loops, which are chopped into slices and played back by MIDI notes. When you use Dr REX's To Track button, MIDI clips are created that play back the loop with the exact timing of the original recorded performance. These note sequences can be affected by the ReGroove mixer like any other, allowing you to change the feel of REX loops. In order for loops to be affected by velocity variations as well as timing, you need to turn up the Velocity To Amp knob on the Dr REX device. Using ReGroove can overcome one of the great problems of loop-based song-writing. Often, electronically produced songs feel disjointed because the layered loops have different feels. In the example picture (right), I've added conga and bass guitar loops. In their original form, neither of these fit with each other, or with the Redrum pattern. Pre-aligning the loops' note sequences and applying the same groove template as the hi-hats makes the parts immediately begin to gel better. However, you can now go further, adjusting the groove amount and the other settings until you hear the point where everything is obviously 'in the pocket'. In the example track, the bass guitar really fell into place when some shuffle was added, introducing some swing to the runs between the main notes. Roll Your Own ReGroove can be used to change the feel of REX loops. The inherent timing in the loop (which can be seen in the MIDI clip) can be removed by using the Pre Align button. ReGroove can be used to change the feel of REX loops. The inherent timing in the loop (which can be seen in the MIDI clip) can be removed by using the Pre Align button. Once you've been hooked by the ReGroove mixer you'll probably want to start adding your own grooves to the pot. This is pretty much the same kind of process as you would find in previous incarnations of Reason. Simply right-click on a notes clip that has a feel you like, and choose Get Groove From Clip. Reason will analyse the timing and velocity variations in the Clip and create a template. This will immediately replace the groove in whichever ReGroove channel currently has the active Edit button. If you want to save the template to disk, so that you can load it into other channels, you can save it by clicking the Save button in the Groove page of the Tool Window. Like many, I was initially fairly underwhelmed by the idea of the ReGroove mixer. However, after getting to know it I've come to think this could prove to be one of the most significant developments in MIDI sequencing for a long time -- I can't think of anything else that can do what it does. If you mostly make straight-cut electronic music or techno, ReGroove will probably do little to change what you do in Reason. However, if electro, house or hip-hop -- not to mention rock or jazz -- are your thing, you're seriously missing a trick if you don't give the ReGroove mixer a go. 0 Global Shuffle The Global Shuffle knob to the left of the ReGroove panel replaces the Pattern Shuffle knob that was found in the Transport bar in earlier versions of Reason. This knob sets the amount of shuffle applied to any Redrum, Matrix and RPG8 devices that have their Shuffle buttons activated. In previous versions, you could apply the Pattern Shuffle to any sequence of MIDI notes, by selecting them and choosing Shuffle from the Quantise menu. This allowed you to match the feel of MIDI tracks and step-sequenced parts. You can still do exactly this, using the Quantise section of the the Tool Window. However, you can now also apply the Global Shuffle to any track in real time using the Global Shuffle button found at the bottom of each ReGroove channel. This overrides the channel's local Shuffle knob. Regular Quantise Simple grid quantisation is still treated like an edit task in Reason 4. The familiar Quantise controls that used to be in the sequencer's toolbar have now been moved to the Tools tab of the Tool Window. It's a shame that a straight quantise option is not included in the ReGroove mixer. This would allow you to add grid quantisation by varying degrees with a fader, instead of by the limited range of preset amounts that are offered in the Tool Window. No matter -- it's very simple to add this feature yourself, by creating a groove template with no groove. To do this, you need to use the Get Groove From Clip command on a one bar clip with 16 straight hits at 16th-note intervals. The quickest way to generate such a clip is to create a Redrum, select all 16 steps on any drum, set a one-bar loop with the Left and Right timeline locators, then use the Copy Pattern To Track command. Now you can use the steps detailed in the main text to extract and save a groove template from the clip. You can then load this clip into ReGroove channels and apply varying amounts of grid quantisation to tracks. Anchor Points An important setting in the ReGroove mixer is the Anchor Point. This tells Reason which bar your song starts on. In my example track, the song starts on bar one, but if there is an intro section or a pick-up measure you need to make sure that the Anchor Point is set to the bar that your song actually kicks in on. This is because many groove templates are more than one bar long, and need to be aligned correctly with your song.

September 13, 2012 Special Guest: Brett House, Sauv Senior Fellow Oluwatosin Omole The Sauv Foundation hosted its third Special Guest of the 2012-2013 Sauv Program year on Thursday, 13th September, 2012. The  guest was Brett House , the Sauv Foundation's Senior Visiting Fellow, who is residing in and working at Sauv House this year. Brett House comes to the Sauv Foundation with a wide range of experience in the public sector, academia and the private sector. He has worked with amongst other institutions, the IMF, Woodbine Capital Advisors, Goldman Sachs, Oxford University and the office of the UN Secretary General. Brett has a history of association with the Sauv Program, having been here in 2009 when he accompanied the UN Deputy Secretary-General and Prof. Jeffrey Sachs on a visit. Brett started by thanking everyone for welcoming him, noting that he is very excited to be part of the Sauv community. He spoke about his journey in life to date and his plans for his time at Sauv House this year. A Canadian, Brett was born in Ontario and attended Pearson College in Victoria and Queens University in Kingston, Ontario. He was a participant at the 1992 Earth Summit (along with Dsire McGraw) and recounted that the experience was transformative because it provided practical and hands-on exposure to the challenges of economic development. It was also very notable because he learnt how to speak Portuguese after spending 3 months in Brazil that year. His time at the IMF was particularly significant because he was able to assist many low-income countries in restructuring their economies. He was also involved in "developing the IMF's policies and models on emerging market vulnerabilities, early-warning systems for financial crises, sovereign debt restructuring and debt relief programmes." At Sauv House this year, Brett intends to research the interactions between trade, growth and development. He also aims to assess the effects of the rise of emerging markets on G10 economies and to design models for impact investing. Brett will also continue his work on frameworks for sovereign debt restructuring. And he will evaluate how to forecast growth in economies on the basis of the performance of major companies and ask how this can be used to make policy decisions. His previous work is complementary to many of the projects Scholars plan to carry out this year. Brett is looking forward to assisting the Scholars through his experience and network. Brett also talked about his values, the most important being accessibility, transparency and honesty. He shared other significant ideas that have helped him so far in life, advising that we "not make the perfect the enemy of the good." (In other words, we should not let a quest for perfection crowd out progress.) He also said that "assuming the best will almost always lead to the best." Brett also offered some advice specifically to the Sauv Scholars, noting that "...there is usually a focus on small things, but instead, focus on the larger things... on the big picture". He also advised Scholars to develop expertise in one specific field and to use that to create and influence change. Thereafter, Brett asked everyone in the room to talk about something not on their rsum and a current challenge they are facing. This generated a very interesting conversation with lots of varied responses. We look forward to continuing our conversation with Brett throughout the year! "Leaders must dream of changing the world. They must have an inspired vision of the changes they want to make and be prepared to consecrate all their energy to that purpose. A capacity to communicate their objectives is indispensable to sustain the enthusiasm of their collaborators and their perseverance in action." -- The Right Honourable Jeanne Sauv, Opening Speech to the National Conference for Young Leaders, June 2-8, 1991
ID	Author Topic: Suarez Defends Referees  (Read 8299 times) Liverpool striker Luis Suarez is trying to remain philosophical about the refereeing decisions that have gone against him this season. Brendan Rodgers revealed on Thursday that he had voiced his concerns to referees' chief Mike Riley about what the Reds manager sees as a number of unfair judgements in the opening weeks of the season. In particular, he referenced legitimate penalty claims by Suarez which had been turned down with, on one occasion, the Uruguay international being booked for diving. But Suarez said: "There are times when the referee gets it right and others when he doesn't but that's all part and parcel of the game. "It's happened in the last few games, like against Manchester United when the penalty shout on me wasn't given and then the one on (Antonio) Valencia was. "But talking about it doesn't solve anything - the referee has a split second to see an incident. Let's just hope that it doesn't happen again in the future." Those poor decisions have contributed to a slow start to the season which has yielded just four goals in five league games and sees the Reds languishing in the relegation places. But Suarez insists that with some tough early fixtures out of the way, the Reds are now well-placed to start picking up some victories. "It makes it more difficult when your opening fixtures of the season are against strong teams like Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United - they are not easy games," he told the official Liverpool website. "At the moment, we are not in the position where Liverpool Football Club has to be, which is battling it out at the top end of the league. "But we've been a bit unlucky and I still believe - and will continue to believe - that we have a lot of quality here and a manager who is giving everyone the confidence to believe in their opportunities." The socialism I believe in is everybody working for the same goal and everybody having a share in the rewards. That's how I see football, that's how I see life. You have to have a sense of the past, a sense of the present and a sense of the future and whatever it takes to make Liverpool succesful, then my life is devoted. It's all part of the dance Good on him for saying it to be honest, you never know maybe the refs might take notice. But I feel that they'll soon forget the first time he shows a passionate dislike for one of their shit decisions. Logged And when you find yourself along the untrodden path Remember me with a smile, a drink, a gesture or a laugh And a toast for the man who loves every hour of every day And a feast for the friends and faces met along way Gratitude But I feel that they'll soon forget the first time he shows a passionate dislike for one of their shit decisions. Yeah but thats in the heat of battle and I wouldn't want him any other way. Logged The socialism I believe in is everybody working for the same goal and everybody having a share in the rewards.

Nope nor would I, but that doesn't stop the fact that he might need to tone it down on the pitch to actually start getting the decisions again. Bit hypocritical what i've just put there I know.....

When you can't crawl, you get a friend to carry you" - Firefly Very good move on the back of what Rodgers said yesterday. It keeps the story (poor ref decisions) in the headlines, which can have an effect on refs. It's how the likes of man u do it, only with less grace. Rafa Benitez: "I'll always keep in my heart the good times I've had here, the strong and loyal support of the fans in the tough times and the love from Liverpool.

I doubt it, but making more statements like this certainly won't hurt. Unfortunatly there isn't much more he can try in the field of play. If he tries to stand on his feet, it is play on despite contact. If he goes down when there is contact, he gets brandished a diver. If he aplauds the ref or gives the thumbs up to the linesman it is construed as a sarcastic gesture and he gets lambasted for it. If he queries a decision he gets booked or brandished a racist. Still despite all this he keeps fighting for his shirt and believing. Hopefully, at least he can gain some respect among the refs association, so that he will be given a fairer go on the field in the future. You have posted literally nothing of substance to flame about.  Your "points", and I dread to call them that, were superficial and completely arbitrary.  Nothing you said could be argued against because nothing you said elaborated a position of any kind. I like this, very clever PR by the club.

Yet another little sign of things clicking. Brendan Rodgers said 'you don't train players you educate them'. I think with the media it is the other way around. After what Louis Suarez said, I think our captain should do what Justin Fashanou of Wimbeldon used to do, he searches the referees background and finds out their wives and kids names, then on match days when he shakes hands at the start of the match, he asks the refs ' how is Mrs such and such', the referee never books or make a decision against him in the match. Clever really. I like this, very clever PR by the club.

It gets the message accross about the referees whilst painting Suarez in a decent light.

Good to see us trying to be smarter in the PR department as we have been dire at it in recent years.
NA	Since we're nearing the end of the first half of the local dirt-track season -- is that hard to believe or what? -- let's look ahead to the second half and see what we might expect. Back in 2007, we started tracking second-half points to see what drivers finish the season(s) strong and who might he the guys to watch the following year. It's far from any sort of exact science, but the annual "leader" does show who has been the strongest down the stretch. The career leaders illustrate who has been the most consistent.
NA	Early in the season, Adam Hadwin said he would like to make it to the PGA Tour by virtue of his play on the Web.com Tour, and not have to rely on qualifying school. But, after being gutted by James Hahn at last week's Web.com Tour Championship, the Abbotsford, B.C., native, who turns 25 on Friday, will have to return again to the gruelling Q-school, albeit with a pass to the final stage. You have to feel for Hadwin, who fell agonizingly short of his PGA Tour card when Hahn -- with a clutch up-and-down on 18 -- knocked him down into third place when a second would have put him on the top tour for 2013. (It was classy that he stayed around to support and cheer on his compatriot and roommate Brad Fritsch, who was successful in earning his card). But, finishing 30th on the money list in his rookie season on the Web.com Tour is no small feat and the experience will help him down the line, should he fail to advance through Q-school at the end of the month. "If you're top 25 on this tour, it speaks a lot more volume than you just getting hot for three weeks and getting your card that way," Hadwin said as his 2012 campaign kicked off. "It's worth a lot more in my eyes, than just getting through Q-school." And, almost cryptically after missing a couple of early cuts, Hadwin said that it didn't really matter as long as he finished strong. "Really, I only have one goal this year and that's to be in the top 25 at the end of the year to get a PGA Tour card," said Hadwin. "It doesn't really matter how I get there." In a season in which Hadwin made just 13 of 25 cuts, he damn near achieved his goal. You have to think that with his rookie season out of the way and knowing exactly what to expect, the young man will be full of confidence and perhaps a little more consistent in pursuit of his PGA Tour dream. THE LOVE CONTINUES The Phil Mickelson-Keegan Bradley love affair continues. While the stars of the American side at the Ryder Cup this week admitted they're still hurting over the Sunday drubbing the U.S. took at the hands of the Europeans, they said there are some positives they have taken away from their time together. "Looking back though, there was some good that came from it in that I had a great couple of days playing with Keegan as a partner," Mickelson said in a news conference for the World Golf Championships HSBC Championship in Guangdong, China. "We played some good golf early on and I saw some things where I can improve my game. "I saw an opportunity to, if I could drive the ball the way Keegan did, I would really have some opportunities and chances to do something special in my career and have some of my best finishes." So, the Golf Hall of Famer is going to learn from his young protege, a PGA Tour sophomore? "It's the first I've heard of that. It's pretty unbelievable," said Bradley after hearing the praise of his partner, with whom he went 3-0 in Ryder Cup matches. "You know, in the alternate"'shot format, I was putting Phil in some great spots, and Phil with a wedge or any sort of iron from the fairway is deadly. If he's got a wedge and it's outside five feet, I'm shocked. "So I think he's going to try to focus in on getting the ball in the fairway more and in play, because he's the absolute best iron player I've ever seen. If he can do that more consistently, he'll win so many times more and he'll be competitive well past and in his 50s. "But that's a huge honour to me that he would even say that to people ... it's actually kind of shocking to me right now." The former world No. 1, who decided that he needed to revamp his swing to be able to add a draw and not rely so much on his natural fade, had struggled over the past couple of years and it seems now he's back to what works. "Yeah, I think to bury that topic for the next few years, we can say it's over, I'm done," Kaymer said at his HSBC Champions news conference. "I'm very happy the way I hit the ball and my fade is back, the natural shot." Kaymer explained his tinkering at the Ryder Cup, before going on to sink the clinching putt for Europe: "There was never really a problem. But every time I left Augusta, I was very frustrated, not because I had just missed the cut but the way I missed the cut, because I had no idea how it feels to hit a draw," he said. "So at that stage I was 25 and I thought I had a lot of years ahead of me and I don't want to live with that, just hitting a fade my entire life." After his descent from No. 1 in the world to No. 35, where he stands at the moment, maybe Kaymer has decided it's better to fade away than go back to the drawing board. SAUCY TALKS Not everyone is on board with the new system of getting your PGA Tour card exclusively through the Web.com Tour. Abbotsford, B.C., native James Lepp, currently a contestant on Golf Channel's Big Break, says it takes away an opportunity for guys who can't commit to playing golf full-time. Lepp didn't make it through the first round of Q-school this year, but he explained on his blog at his shoe company Kikkor Golf's site why he likes the format better. "I wish they would stick with the old system! I'm sitting here running a golf shoe company, so I don't exactly have the time to slowly progress my way to the PGA Tour. I need the three week tournament to get hot in," Lepp wrote. "The rule change is a major reason why I decided to give it a go this past week. Unfortunately, it didn't pan out."
ID	Other Answers (12) I believe Jesus knew how He was going to die, and the reason for it, by the time he was 12 years old. When He was 12, He was already at the synagogue, teaching the elders what He knew. Surely by then He knew what His destiny was.. Well, we don't know exactly but it was long before it happened because Jesus tried to tell his disciples but they didn't understand him. It may have been really early at the time when we read of Jesus at the age of twelve having got left behind at the Temple in Jerusalem. His mother Mary and guardian Joseph had thought that Jesus was with other members of the family who had gone up to Jerusalem and returned and when they couldn't find him they returned searching for him. After a few days they found him in the Temple listening to and questioning the Teachers there. It is recorded that they were astonished at Jesus' understanding of the Old Testament Scriptures which speak of his suffering. When Jesus was baptised in the River Jordan by John the Baptist he received the power of the Holy Spirit, God's power and I feel sure that he would then have really understood the significance of all that his Heavenly Father wanted him to do. They were taken out of their cells and told that they were going to be crowned King of the Jews and they felt they were being set free for the Feast of the Passover but Pilate had other plans. It was only after they were stripped and beaten and spat upon by Pilate's and Herod's soldiers that they realised that something was not exactly right. They got to Golgotha, were nailed to their crosses, lifted above the crowds, and then they knew they were set up for crucifixion in place of the Christ as everybody along the way called them Christ as they were fooled into believing that Christ was being crucified. Source(s): God had told him the night before while he was praying and he began to sweat blood because of the stress he had... he even pleeded to God if there was any other way to redeem us of our sins but there wasn't so Jesus "nutted up" and went thru with the crucifixion
OP	Lessons from the Industry Formerly Known as "The Record Business" A record company's value used to be measured by the acquisition, protection, and exploitation of copyrights. Exploiting those copyrights by selling songs is an easy business model to understand and used to be the foundation of a very healthy global industry. Historically, the record business was the heart of the music industry. Sell a lot of records and you were a successful business. And artists also succeeded through record sales: they became household names when they had sold a lot of records. From the business perspective, artists and songs could be viewed as interchangeable commodities. If any given artist failed to deliver hits, another waited in the wings to take their place. This impersonal approach allowed the music industry to grow extremely profitable by simply selling "product." But the sale of recorded music has taken a battering over the last decade, and it's no longer smart to judge an artist's commercial viability on record sales alone -- not least when there is a new generation who questions the need to pay for recorded music at all. For many artists and their managers, record sales are now just one of many revenue streams and one of a number of factors with which to judge success. Despite this dramatic change in the marketplace, many struggle with the concept of uncoupling success from record sales. It doesn't help that most measures -- the charts by which many fans learn about new music -- are still based on this notion. For emerging artists this is particularly precarious, since careers are too often ended early if a first set of recordings fail to sell. So how should a "content producer" behave in this new environment? And what lessons can we learn from this new model of value? Here are the two keys: Do not treat artists as commodities Value the artist-fan relationship as highly as traditional rights Smart managers realize every artist is a standalone business that generates income from multiple revenue streams. A manager's job is to create those businesses and run them well. This requires thinking globally and being agnostic about which revenue stream or territory is the most important. As long as those channels can deliver the aesthetic the artist wants and make a profit, the business is a success. But the business of relationship building is not a quick one. Artists have to earn the respect of fans, convert that respect into trust, and, eventually, convert that trust into faith. Building communities takes time, and it can only be achieved over the long-term. In this model, artists can no longer be treated as interchangeable hit makers. The key to artist-management success is identifying talent early and developing it cost-effectively over a long period of time. Artists -- and their art -- are the only real assets. The systems and structures that surround them should be treated as a means to maximize the commercial value of each artist. As such, the traditional music industry -- be that companies that make and distribute records, publishers who collect performance royalties and create sync opportunities, concert promoters, or merchandisers -- should be regarded primarily as service providers to artists. As the digital age gathers pace, managers must engage in the shaping of the music landscape. That landscape is still plagued by a mindset that regards copyright as an instrument of control (which further limits commercial exploitation to traditional models) rather than as a remuneration right that can generate revenue wherever a market may be. The future is about accepting consumer behavior and looking for as many ways as possible to monetize it. In addition, managers must also simplify the complex structures of the industry and create healthy businesses based on monetizing the behavior of consumers and those businesses that wish to use creators' works for their own profit. Without a simpler, better structured digital market, the direct artist-to-fan business will struggle to grow. Moreover, it will undermine the modern-day manager's opportunities to improve their artists' business. Managers must also figure out alternative investment for artist businesses. Traditionally, it was the record business that invested in new talent. Restricting investment to direct rights exploitation keeps the emphasis on making money from record sales, which keeps the "investment risk" for would-be investors high. A viable alternative would be a market for investors to put their money into artists' whole businesses, where artists retain rights and investors participate in all the profits. The music industry was the first of the creative industries to be affected by the disruptive nature of the internet. But it's not all bad news. Disintermediation has forced a focus on talented individuals who produce great art. One of the jobs of their managers is to create an environment that allows them to do so. Ways of collecting fans and connecting them to artists are ever changing, but by embracing new technology opportunities, creative businesses will flourish. Other content producers take note. James Barton and Brian Message are featured artist managers based in London. Both are representatives of the Music Managers Forum (MMF) UK, the largest representative body of featured artist management in the world, with over 400 members representing over 1,000 of the most successful acts on the planet. Featured artist managers in the UK earn a commission based on the act's profits and as such their financial interests are aligned.

NA	Delegation of the EU to Australia newsletter 343 Launch of the publication "New South Wales: a Global Destination for the World of Business" Speaking at the launch of the publication " New South Wales: a Global Destination for the World of Business " H.E. David Daly, Ambassador of the European Union to Australia, congratulated the NSW Parliament on being the first state legislature in Australia to have an official Parliamentary Friends of the European Union group. Stressing the importance of NSW as a destination for European business, Ambassador Daly said "From Lismore, Armidale and Newcastle, down to Wollongong, Yass and Wagga Wagga, and out to Dubbo, Bourke and beyond, this is a rich and diverse State. NSW is renowned as a business and financial centre. Europeans certainly know this as evidenced by the large number of European companies and investment centred here." Mr Daly also emphasised the importance of research exchanges between Europe and Australia, and didn't sidestep the subject on everyone's mind: Europe's sovereign debt and banking crisis. " We are indeed at a defining moment -- for the European economy and for European integration. During the past two and a half years, the European Union has enacted important financial, fiscal and structural reforms. However, amidst ongoing tensions the economic recovery remains at risk ." said Ambassador Daly, but concluded on a positive note: " The EU's short existence of some 60 years has been littered by crises which led many commentators to predict its imminent demise. They were not right then, and they are not right now." The full speech can be read on the Delegation's website Australia and Europe in conversation - number 7 Every month this year, two or three Ambassadors and/or High Commissioners from EU Member States, together with Australian Ambassadors to Europe and other experts, will gather at the ANUCES to talk about their country and why it joined the EU, their current position and how their country interacts with Australia. Most of the events will be recorded and broadcast by Radio National's "Big Ideas" program, and filmed by the Sky A-Pac Channel. This month we are fortunate to be joined by H.E. Mr Enrique Viguera, Ambassador for Spain to Australia, H.E. Mr Krassimir Stefanov, Ambassador for Bulgaria to Australia and New Zealand, and Mr Noel Campbell, Official Secretary and Chief of Staff, Office of the Governor of New South Wales, who will together discuss the fifty years of relations between Australia and the EU. Joining them will be Mr Paul Bongiorno, National Affairs Editor at Network Ten, who will moderate the discussion. Date: Wednesday 29 August 2012 5.30 -- 6.30pm.

Dr Ruete joined EABC members and guests for a boardroom forum to discuss European Union transport policy, including the European Commission's 2011 Transport White Paper. The forum was co-hosted by EABC Major Partner Brambles, and chaired by Brambles Chief Executive Officer, Tom Gorman. Dr Ruete discussed recent European Union policies and initiatives for its recovery from the current economic and financial crisis in Europe, including the four key areas of focus for EU Transport policy: the internal market; innovation; infrastructure; and international relations. Dr Ruete also shared his insights on the 2011 White Paper ' Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area' and its ongoing influence on EU transport policy. Other areas of discussion included PPPs and alternative funding models, the ongoing sovereign debt crisis, and aircraft safety standards. A detailed Forum Report is available from the EABC website . 19 August 2012 -- World Humanitarian Day: People Helping People August 19 is World Humanitarian Day, a global day to celebrate humanity and the spirit of people helping people.  At the same time, this day commemorates the largest single attack on aid workers, when the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General to Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello and 21 of his colleagues were killed in the bombing of the UN Headquarters in Baghdad on 19 August 2003.  On this day, the international community pays tribute to all of the humanitarian workers who have lost their lives doing their job, and reiterates the message that humanitarians should be given safe and secure access to the victims of human-made and natural disasters without exception. Humanitarian work is becoming one of the world's most dangerous professions. Kidnappings, shootings and death threats are part of the job description in places such as Afghanistan, Sudan, Syria, Somalia and others blighted by conflict. Indeed over 800 humanitarian workers have been killed trying to get aid to those in need in the last 10 years, and another 1300 have been kidnapped or wounded. read more European Union mobilises emergency aid to help flood victims in the Philippines Following massive flooding in the Philippines, national authorities have begun a large-scale emergency response. The European Commission will complement on-going efforts with _700,000 of humanitarian aid which will be distributed through its partner organisations.  The Commission's humanitarian funding will assist 127,000, poor and vulnerable people, including those in remote communities which have been cut off. The money will be used primarily to provide food, water, shelter, medical aid and sanitation, as well as to help clean-up debris.  The Commission is a long-term provider of humanitarian assistance in South-East Asia, where it brings relief to the victims of displacement, conflict and natural disasters and where it advocates for and supports measures for disaster preparedness and risk reduction. In 2010 and 2011, the Commission has provided humanitarian assistance worth more than _65 million in the region. read more Culture's role in the EU's external relations Androulla Vassiliou, European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth, was amongst the keynote speakers at the international summit on culture which took place during the Edinburgh International Festival on 13-14 August. " The over-arching policy of the European Union is to promote cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue; to unlock the potential of culture for creativity and innovation; and to make full use of culture in the development of our relations with partners around the world," said Commissioner Vassiliou " This is why culture and the arts are such a binding force for our societies and regions across the world. They connect people in different countries and from different ethnic groups, breaking through language barriers and rising above prejudice. Through the arts, people discover shared values; they are able to have a conversation of equals." The European Commission's Directorate General for Education and Culture has selected Australia as a Cultural Cooperation partner for 2013 .  Australian cultural organisations are encouraged to take part in this exciting opportunity to promote cross-border cultural understanding with European organisations.  For 2013, funds for cooperation projects can be used by Australian cultural organisations in collaboration with European partners.  The European Union will co-finance up to half of the project costs to a maximum of _200,000 per project, projects must involve three cultural operators from at least three different participating European countries, together with at least one organisation in Australia, and at least half of the project activities should take place in Australia.  The deadline for applications is 3 May 2013. read more European Year for Active Ageing To raise awareness about the ageing population, 2012 has been designated European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations. The aim is to strengthen relevant policies and initiatives across Europe and promote opportunities for economic growth and job creation resulting from the development of the "silver economy". The proportion of older people is increasing steadily compared to the share of younger members of European societies. From 2012, the working-age population will start to shrink, while the number of over-60s will increase rapidly, by about two million people per year. This demographic development poses a series of challenges, especially in today's economic context.  Active ageing should allow European senior citizens to prolong their participation in the labour market, to keep playing an active role in society for longer, staying healthy and remaining independent.  The initiative invites citizens, politicians and civil society organisations to consider how to create better conditions for senior citizens and strengthen intergenerational solidarity. The European Year calls for action in different fields - labour market policies, social protection, education and training, health and social services, housing and public infrastructure. read more European economy Euro area annual inflation was 2.4% in July 2012, stable compared to June.

NA	i say "we" because i don't assume that many reading this have been using the internet long enough to remember those times. but i got my first internet access right around the time when 33.6k modems (which REALLY must have been insane) were replaced by 56k ones. and right now, i'm on a shitty mobile connection that was throttled to 64kbit because i used up my data volume. how do those motherfuckers not receive daily death threats?! now, you may argue "that's a little harsh?". not when you pay 25? for fucking FIVE gigabytes! that's simply outrageous! one should hand-deliver those 25?. in nickel rolls. up the CEO's ass. i bet those bastards are laughing their asses off with those 10000% profit margins. at least a couple of years ago, one gigabyte traffic cost providers about one or two cents. sure, they have to create/expand the infrastructure and keep it running. but i very much doubt that that justifies such a huge mark-up. but... enough about the politics about it. i actually wanted to write about downloading ONE song which takes me 25 minutes... sure, 15 years ago, songs... hell, i don't think mp3 was even around yet when i first got internet access. i think the first codec was just released by the fraunhofer institute about 1-2 years afterwards. and those 5 second 500KB porn clips... haha! or of course 30 seconds with a resolution of about 320x240. reminds me of meeting a friend i met while sharing porn on IRC. who i stayed friends with for years and met a couple of times. a... IRC and friends. oh brother, how the web has changed... well... i suppose back then, we were just a bunch of kids. although no... now that i think about it, the age average was more around early twenties. and thinking about age reminds me of... of the fact that i always used to have crushes on older girls/women. in this case, i was about 15 and she was... i believe 28. i believe i met her when i was 16-ish and i still remember very vividly standing in front of a store, waiting for her, trying to spot her (back then, no cell phones yet...). but once she appeared there was no question about whether it was her or somebody else. i must have been staring at her in a quite flabbergasted manner. her of course being gorgeous and confident (oh yeah, i don't think i have ever mentioned here exactly HOW shy and awkward i was as a teenager...) walks briskly towards me with a big smile and a penetrating look on her face. and then... she bowed down (she was one of those tall, model-like types - aside from a huge nose. not that it bothered me but i'd rather keep her in my mind and describe her as she was and not exaggerate...) to kiss me hello on the cheek. probably was the first time that a woman kissed me who was not related to me... left me a nervous mess. i wonder what the hell we talked about because i imagine i wasn't exactly articulate back then. and somewhat more interesting than that... she knew how i felt and i think even before we met, at some point, she messages me on IRC: "yes i'm shaved". at first, i thought to myself "huh? what does she shave? .. [2-3 seconds pass] .. why would she tell me that out of the blue?", so to clarify, i ask her what she means. she replies "it's like a little arrow pointing down ". after which either i asked her or she realized that she typed those things into the wrong window... haha. of course... considering her level of confidence, she didn't feel embarrassed too long. and... thinking about that now... a woman that hot talking about intimate details with people online... well... i'm not sure that still happens. but it obviously used to about 15 years ago. of course... to bring the whole thing back down to reality... i actually never talked that much to her and i randomly met her years after we sort of lost contact... at i believe the last rave i ever attended. at about 6 a.m., when i just went home. she was "already" almost 35 years old and still partying like there was no tomorrow. at least for a while there that kind of disappointed me because it seemed to me that she had not changed at all in 5 years or so. although now, i have to say... i think it's nice when people stick to what they enjoy instead of giving them up because it's not socially acceptable. hm... maybe i should try to figure out her current contact details and chat her up. although... even though i would possibly be better at talking to her and i'm actually of legal age now... one of the problems with attractive and social women is - it's tough to know whether they are even interested in one. i talked about this before... because they tend to have "that" look on their face most of the time, it's hard to know when it means "fuck me, fuck me now!" and when it means "i'm just being nice/overly confident". and i would just find it very shitty if i would actually make a move and soil those nice memories with a harsh rejection. which is by the way why i rarely ever even make a move. whatever there is that causes me to want to make a move is obviously nice. and i don't want to destroy "nice". and i don't want to destroy possibilities. because maybe today, it is too early for her. but tomorrow, it may not be.
NA	TFWA AP 2012 conference and exhibition well attended TFWA Asia Pacific & Gate ONE2ONE kicked off last week in Singapore with the conference and workshop portion of the event. The hall was filled as President of TFWA Erik Juul-Mortensen took the stage at the morning plenary session. He spoke of the complexity of the Asian market and reminded attendees of the danger of oversimplifying: "China represents the single greatest opportunity for us in travel retail today, but it's not the only one," Juul-Mortensen said. He noted that it is China's hunger for luxury brands that is the real driver of growth for travel retail and made it clear that suppliers must know exactly what these consumers want in terms of products. "China is vast and it should be treated as a collection of separate countries," Jull-Mortensen noted. As a means of getting those in attendance thinking about upcoming topics, Juul-Mortensen gave some interesting statistics. A compound annual growth rate of 43% in the Chinese upper middle class is forecast for between 2010 and 2015. Furthermore, China is now the second largest economy after the US. Touching on the topic of technology, Juul-Mortensen said that 70% of Chinese search the internet before making a purchase. Despite concentrating on China for a good portion of his speech, Juul-Mortensen did indicate just how diverse the Asia market is when noting that according to the BBC, Mongolia is currently the fastest-growing economy in the world. As such, we need to spot tomorrow's winners now, he said. Countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar are among the big opportunities now in Asia Pacific travel retail, Juul-Mortensen explained. An industry united Sunil Tuli, President of APTRA, then took the stage to discuss the importance of working together as an industry for the good of the whole. While he noted that the industry has made some great strides in coming together over recent years, he said more can be done. "Is every company selflessly contributing to industry causes?" he asked. Tuli noted that significant ground has been gained in combating the threat to travel retail tobacco but much work remained. He also indicated that the industry shouldn't become complacent; alcohol is also a target for some countries and organizations. "We should all be doing everything we can to protect this industry whenever it comes under attack. We should join hands and work together." In the case of APTRA specifically, Tuli noted that the organization continues to advocate on the part of the industry both in the long and short term. Both Juul-Mortensen and Tuli took the opportunity to remind attendees about the TFWA Conference in Beijing in 2013. "We will be working alongside our members and TFWA to ensure that this is a constructive event," said Tuli. Visions of the future Chandran Nair, CEO of GIFT (Global Institute for Tomorrow) next took the stage to discuss the wide variety of experiences across Asia, reminding those in attendance that luxury brands and China's upper middle class isn't the whole story by any means when it comes to Asia. "Most of us are in denial about what's going on," he said, explaining that there is a limit to growth and government policies will have to change as populations increase and the world moves from "debt-driven consumption" to a new model. The population of the world will be about 10 billion at 2050, he said. About 6 billion of these people will live in the Asia Pacific region. "Those of us who are honest will realize that 5 to 6 billion people living in Asia and aspiring to live like Europeans isn't going to happen," he opined. "For us to prosper in a business setting we need prosperous communities," Nair explained. He noted that resource management will no doubt affect retail in the future and that government and businesses will need to work together more than ever in the future to "get it right." "They work in the world" Eraldo Poletto, CEO of Furla, then took the stage to discuss his personal experiences as an Italian working in the US for many years and the interesting mix of values that he tries to bring to his work at Furla. The days of viewing worldwide retail through a Western lens are over, he said. "At the end of the day the challenge is making my people understand that they don't work in Italy -- they work in the world." Poletto noted that one challenge to working in the growing Asian market is that "Europeans are very nostalgic and look to the past. Here [in Asia] it's all about the future." Part of his focus at Furla, he said, is finding a way to ensure that the company's tradition and values do not impede growth but rather stand as pillars which promote further innovation. Morning workshops Workshop A was titled "China Revisited" and examined Chinese consumers, travel retail and the international traveler in China, and domestic travel retail. The workshop featured Charles Chen, Vice President of China Duty Free Group; Derek Sadubin, COO of CAPA; Gary Stasiulevicuis, Managing Director of Counter Intelligence Retail; and Chandran Nair. Workshop B was themed "Emerging Asia" and focused on the significant opportunities in parts of Asia other than the oft-discussed markets of China and India. Participating in the discussion were Martin Roll, CEO of Marten Roll Company; Chim Esteban, CEO of Landmark Duty Free Philippines; Stu Lloyd, Senior Director of Pacific Asia Travel Association; Richard Ferne, Area Director for Camus; and Anastasia Wahyuni, Head of Corporate Communications for Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. Afternoon workshops Workshop C, "Technology Talk," dealt with social media and smartphone technologies and how travel retail can open up more opportunities to engage with consumers. On hand for the workshop were Simon Kemp, Managing Director of We Are Social (Singapore); Shashank Nigam, CEO of SimpliFlying; Brett Henry, Vice-President, Marketing and Vice-President, India at Abacus International; and Ludovic Ngamy, Managing Director of Tactineo. At the closing plenary session, Jonathan Chippindale, CEO of Holition spoke on "Creating a powerful customer experience." Chippindale gave numerous examples of how retailers can engage with consumers in new and thought-provoking ways, discussing augmented reality and other experiential marketing. The exhibition The exhibition hall was busy throughout the week, with many companies noting that they had packed schedules for the entire show. Below are some of the booths that caught our attention when walking the floor at this year's TFWA AP exhibition. The numbers At the closing press conference, Erik Juul-Mortensen and the TFWA Board of Directors provided the press with statistics related to this year's TFWA AP event. There were 236 exhibiting companies, up 11% from last year's show. Of these companies, 62 were new exhibitors. The space occupied by stands was 11,000 square meters, a number also up from last year. Importantly for suppliers, the number of operators attending the show was up by 14% over last year. For the conference portion, 800 people attended over the course of the day. The hall was full, said Juul-Mortensen, and a special overflow room was used to accomodate conference-goers. Attendence at both the Welcome Cocktail and the Chillout Party was up from last year, while 130 fewer people attended the Singapore Swing Party, likely because of the distance from the downtown Singapore. TFWA noted that as always it will fully review this year's conference, exhibition and social activities, making appropriate changes for the coming year. Social events In addition to getting to business, delegates enjoyed themselves at a host of social events organized by TFWA and exhibiting companies throughout the week. Buyers, suppliers, distributors and service providers from across Asia and the Middle East were able to mingle in a relaxed setting. Below are some of the people that Asia Duty Free found enjoying themselves.
SP	This Is Your Energy Entry Point: Mark Lackey Oil prices are starting to creep back up while gas, coal and uranium are poised for moves this fall, according to Mark Lackey, long-time energy analyst now representing resource companies with CHF Investor Relations. In this exclusive interview with The Energy Report , Lackey shares his current insights on energy markets and talks about a number of companies he thinks are sleepers, ready to move quickly when the energy commodities take off. The Energy Report: Since your last interview, you've made a jump from the research side of the business to the investor relations (IR) side. How has the view changed? Mark Lackey: When I worked in the brokerage industry, I relied on IR people to bring me clients and stories, updates on companies I was following or promising companies of which I was never aware. There are over 3,000 companies listed on the TSX and TSX Venture exchanges and you can't know all the stories, so analysts often need introductions. Here at CHF, I'm involved in taking clients, largely in the resource sector, to meet with research and corporate finance people and brokers as well as retail and institutional investors. We also help with companies' press releases, presentations and even market-making. But regardless of whether I'm doing research or IR, it's still a function of whether you believe in commodity cycles and how certain sectors, companies, locations and managements will benefit and profit. TER: Talking to other brokerage firms and people in the investment business, what's the general mood at this point? ML: In the small- and mid-cap market, the mood has been mixed. Some people are negative about the commodities sector in the short run, and some even think the whole commodity cycle is over. Others are more neutral. Then you have a smaller group of people who tend to support my view and are much more positive in the very short run. TER: How does this affect your view of the oil and gas markets? ML: I'm actually quite positive. After getting down below $80/barrel (bbl), West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is now back up over $96/bbl. The Brent price is at $115/bbl. Recent inventory numbers, particularly in the U.S., are down, so there's no overhang in the near term. Demand has hung in reasonably well, considering all the European problems, and there's still decent demand coming from the emerging markets. WTI will likely trade between $100/bbl and $105/bbl next year, with Brent between $115/bbl and $120/bbl. Natural gas has been somewhat weaker, but it bounced off the $2/thousand cubic feet (Mcf) price a few months ago up to the $2.85?3/Mcf range in North America. With more industrial demand coming back, particularly in the auto sector, and stronger demand from electric utilities, gas should move back up closer to $3.25?3.30/Mcf in the next year. By way of comparison, prices in Europe can be anywhere from $4?8/Mcf, and in China they're as high as $15/Mcf. TER: What interesting oil and gas situations have you recently come across that deserve some investor attention? ML: The first company I'd like to talk about is Greenfields Petroleum Corp. (GNF:TSX.V) , which has production in Azerbaijan, a country that used to produce about 70% of the old Soviet Union's oil and gas. Azerbaijan probably has the best history and the best understanding of oil and natural gas relative to most of the other countries in that area. Another advantage there is getting the Brent price for oil. Azerbaijan still has some pretty good land positions available that would be more difficult to get in North America these days. Greenfields has gone back into some of the previously developed areas and is doing more delineation work, rather than wildcat exploration. It also has some greenfields projects. It's going to get some pretty good returns given the prices over there for both natural gas and oil. I think you'll see growing production from this company over the next few years in an area where there's potential to see some real improvement in cash flow. The stock has had pretty nice moves off its lows. With higher expected oil prices in the next year, we would anticipate that the share price should move higher. TER: Is Azerbaijan stable? ML: Yes. Azerbaijan has had an oil and gas industry for over 50 years and recognizes that this is its biggest source of income. It understands the oil and gas industry and this is a relatively good place to do business compared to all the potential places that you could look for oil in the world. TER: Who else is on your radar? ML: We like Primeline Energy Holdings Inc. (PEH:TSX.V) and its prospects in the South China Sea. Its partner is the China National Offshore Oil Co. (CNOOC), which is a huge company. Primeline just put out an updated resource report and should be producing by the middle of next year. With the extremely high natural gas prices in China, the company should have good cash flows and earnings within the next year or two, as well as some pretty good capital appreciation potential. The stock started to gain momentum after the company filed its Overall Development Plan for the Lishui gas project in June and it's now pushing its 52-week high of $0.60. We think it offers investors a really attractive opportunity over the next few years. TER: Oil services have been getting some positive press lately. Are you following any companies in that sector? ML: The oil services side is often overlooked by investors. But drilling activity and rising prices create rising demand for oil services. We represent Bri-Chem Corp. (BRY:TSX) , which is a North American wholesale distributor of oil and gas drilling fluids and piping products to the energy business. Bri-Chem is well integrated in the oil and gas service industry and expanded from Canada to the U.S. last year. It has earnings and cash flow and it is one that investors should be looking at. Up until a couple of years ago, U.S. production had been on the decline for 40 years. But in the last few years, production has increased with improved technology accessing unconventional hydrocarbons, particularly in the shale formations. This has been a boon for many of the oil service companies like Bri-Chem, which is likely to grow its cash flow and earnings even more over the next few years. It's trading around $2.65 and provides a pretty good opportunity for capital appreciation at these levels. TER: Let's talk about the uranium market. Prices have been fairly flat and they've shown a little weakness in the past month. What do you think is happening there? ML: Uranium was $70/pound (lb) back in March 2011 and then drifted down after the Fukushima incident. Japan took steps to close all 56 of its reactors and the Germans have taken out about seven or eight. There are about 445 operating worldwide. The price has been sitting around the $50?$51/lb range for a number of months and recently has gone down to $49/lb on the short-term market. The lower demand in the short run is the reason for the $20 hit. The Japanese have probably gone through three-quarters of their reactors, testing them to make sure they can withstand certain high-strength earthquakes. They are also putting up larger retaining walls and doing other things to prevent future problems from flooding. Our guess is that at least half of those reactors will be back in operation in the next six months and maybe as many as 75?80% of them within the next year, period. Nuclear power accounts for 15% of Japan's needs. Japan's economy really can't function without some nuclear power in order to meet demand; its manufacturing sector requires an ongoing, inexpensive, stable power supply. There are 60 other reactors around the world under construction and about another 240 planned over the next 5?10 years. Another factor is that next year, the phaseout of the Russian exports to the U.S. of highly enriched uranium from its nuclear warheads will end. Thus, demand is coming back and some supply is constrained, which should cause prices to move up in the next couple of years. TER: What stocks do you like in the uranium industry at this point? ML: We have followed Strathmore Minerals Corp. (STM:TSX; STHJF:OTCQX) for a while. It has large positions in both New Mexico and Wyoming, which has produced 90% of past U.S. uranium production. In 1980, the U.S. was the biggest producer of uranium in the world. Today it only produces about 4 million pounds (Mlb) a year, making up about 8% of its needs. Strathmore is sitting on large reserves and has the potential to be a significant producer down the road. It expects to be producing in 2016 out of Wyoming and in 2017 out of New Mexico. The stock price has probably been hurt by the weaker uranium price and the fact that it is three years from production. We expect uranium prices to rise to $65/lb by the end of next year and to $75/lb by the end of 2014. This could be a perfect storm for Strathmore, and the market will start to recognize this stock. I think you'll see quite a bit of capital appreciation over the next two to four years. One of the potential takeover candidates would have to be Fission. It does need to do more drilling and prove up its resource over time. But, it's well positioned, has the money and is certainly in the right address near some of the biggest and highest-grade uranium mines in the world. It has good management and the company is well funded. We think this is a stock that people should also be looking to invest in. As this company moves forward and proves up more reserves, it will become a much more likely takeover candidate, perhaps in the next couple of years. The other company that I like in this sector is Forum Uranium Corp. (FDC:TSX.V) , which is really more of a microcap company, of which I only follow maybe three or four. My interest in Forum is based on its very good project location in the Athabasca Basin and its very experienced management team. Its partner is Rio Tinto, which just took over Hathor and wants to expand in the area. Other than maybe Cameco, you couldn't ask for a better partner. It's done some drilling and needs to do more to move this stock to a point where somebody would consider taking it over. For a micro-cap uranium play, Forum is a good one to look at considering its project and its partner. TER: The other part of the energy market is thermal and metallurgical coal used in steel production. What have those two markets been doing? ML: We tend to follow more of the met coal market. The weakness in the natural gas price, particularly in the U.S., has hurt thermal coal producers, especially in Appalachia, where there are somewhat higher costs. We think the thermal coal market will see some recovery over the next couple of years because it's not just the U.S. that uses thermal coal. Far more thermal coal is used in China than in the U.S. The high-cost producers have been affected the most as thermal prices have been hit as much as 20?30% in the last three to four months. That's made a difference to the bottom lines and investment analysts' view of that sector. The same thing has happened in the met coal market. Because Chinese steel prices, particularly in China, have gone down 20% in the last three months, iron ore has gone down 20%, putting downward pressure on the met coal price because the biggest steel market in the world is China. On the Australian market, the price has gone from $225/ton (t) down to $175/t. We think that this is probably the bottom of the market for steel, iron ore and met coal because construction activity usually picks up dramatically in China in October, November and December. We expect that all three areas will see recovery moving into the fall and through next year. Weakness in the met coal market has affected the prices of all the companies we're going to talk about. I'd rather be buying when the met coal price is $175/t than when it was $225/t three months ago or when it was $300/t at one point last year. Now you can buy these companies at much lower prices and probably get much better value for your money. TER: Let's talk about some of the companies you like. ML: The first one I like is Corsa Coal Corp. (CSO:TSX) , based in Ontario with production largely in Pennsylvania and some in Maryland. It's largely metallurgical, and a little bit thermal. Corsa has very high-quality coal that can be blended because of its low sulfur and ash levels. It's well-located in Pennsylvania near the major U.S. steel industry, which is still the third-largest producer in the world. If you're one of the somewhat bigger neighboring producers in Pennsylvania whose quality of met coal is not as good, I think Corsa could be a good acquisition target. It expects to have some significant increases in production in the next two to three years. With the met price getting back up to the $225/t range over the next year or two, it should have some pretty good cash flow and potential earnings over that time. The stock's trading right now at $0.17/share. I don't follow that many microcaps but Corsa is certainly one of the few I do and like. TER: How about some other ones? ML: Another one we follow is Cline Mining Corp. (CMK:TSX) , a Toronto-based company with a significant met coal operation in Colorado that was about to start production within the last month. The decline in the price of met coal caused the company to postpone start-up and lay off people for 60 days. As a new producer, it could have been difficult to sell any of its coal. I think management did the wise thing by waiting to see if the market will come back in the fall and not build up too much inventory in a weak market. Of course, this disappointed the market and it hit the stock price fairly hard. Cline has very good-quality coal with significant reserves and could be a pretty significant producer within the next two to three years, selling some in the U.S. and shipping some through Texas all the way over to China. With the expansion of the Panama Canal in 2014, bigger ships can go to China and a company like Cline would probably sell most of its coal abroad in the future. TER: What other companies do you like? ML: Colonial Coal International Corp. (CAD:TSX.V) is a western Canadian met coal company in the Peace River area in Alberta. It's in a good met coal-producing area with infrastructure, rail, experienced labor and decent power prices. Colonial is working on developing two very high-quality met coal properties, suitable for coking, with large reserves. There have been a number of takeovers in this area in the last year. And, looking at valuations, this company could certainly be trading at a much higher level if somebody was targeting them. If I had to pick someone in the met coal business in western Canada right now, Colonial would be my most likely acquisition target. Comparing it to the value of some of the other companies out there, its stock price should be considerably higher than where it's trading right now, at around $0.76/share. TER: To wrap things up, give us your general thoughts on where you think things are headed and how the average man on the street should be looking at these energy investments. ML: If you believe we're in a long-term commodities cycle, as we do here at CHF, then this is probably one of the best points to enter these markets. We think oil is going higher, while some of the natural gas prices in the world are already extremely high. Coal and uranium markets appear near the bottom and we expect to see higher prices over the next two to three years. In short, we think this is actually one of the better buying opportunities we've seen in the last decade for small and mid-cap companies in these sectors, and select micro-caps with sound fundamentals. TER: Thanks for talking with us today. There are certainly lots of good opportunities out there.

NA	Toronto Air Show 2012 at the CNE The Toronto Air Show at the 2012 CNE -- or, more properly, the Canadian International Air Show -- has drawn its fair share of criticism over the last few years. Some say it's too loud , while others cite safety concerns. And then there's people who get giddy at the prospect of supersonic jets screaming overhead in Toronto. I'd probably fall in the latter category, my only complaint being that the sound of these planes criss-crossing the city always serves as an inexorable reminder that summer is unofficially over. Here's what you need to know about this year's show. When: Saturday, September 1st to Monday, September 3rd. 12:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Where: The VIP viewing area -- i.e. the one that you need tickets to get into is nestled on the waterfront between Ontario Place and Marilyn Bell Park. The advantage to paying for tickets is that you'll have guaranteed sight lines and a seat. If you only plan to watch for a bit, I'd recommend heading to pretty much any area along the central-western waterfront, with the stretch between Marilyn Bell Park and Sunnyside providing the best views. What to expect: Highlights will include the Canadian Forces' Snowbirds, a CF-18 Hornet (loud!), a F-16C Fighting Falcon, a T-33 "Mako Shark" Demonstration, and the Mike Wiskus & the Lucas Oil Air Show (amongst other performers ) Tips: Aside from the fact that you should know that you don't really need to pay any money to enjoy the air show, the big key for those looking to spend the day watching this display of militarism is that you need to save your spot along the waterfront early if you hope to get the best view of the action. I'd also bring a chair. I hate sitting anywhere without a back rest for too long. I live and work near the airshow grounds and I love it. To be honest, Toronto could get boring from times to times, especially when you get stuck in the work-home-work grind. But the screaming jets that fly just few meters over my head and amazing plane acrobatics give me a reminder that there is more to life than just eat-shit-sleep sequence. This is a one-time in the year event that puts the sonic scape of this city out of ordinary. This can not be a bad thing. If you live anywhere near where the airshow is taking place, then it means you likely live in the core - if that's the case, how the hell can you complain about noise? It never occured to you that it might noisy from time to time in dowtown Toronto? Besides, the airshow takes place during the afternoon. What are you doing on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon in your apartment that requires total silence? I haven't seen the airshow in a few years, and the last time I saw it it was too long with too many similar planes. I remember it being about 3 hours long with a bunch of biplanes that all did the same tricks. I was a kid at the time and easily bored though, I imagine as an adult 3 hours sitting outside on a nice day with cool planes going by and a cold drink would be very nice. I live in North Toronto, but it was really cool seeing and hearing the jets go by every once in a while last year. It's just something really cool that we as Torontonians are lucky to have once a year to make our weekends a little more interesting. No matter where you are that weekend you will always be checking to see if you can see or hear the planes :) Man, you sure got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning! No one said anything about 'total silence.' As a downtowner myself I'm used to noise from traffic, but the planes flying overhead are PAINFULLY LOUD. Besides, in 2012 what sort of person is still impressed by an air show? It's little more than a 4-hour advertisement for the military. Sure it's noisy, then again everything is. For a few hours once a year it's not a big deal. I wish it were noisier. I'd love to hear those planes break the sound barrier. Who gets excited by planes still ? Me. I love the physics, the extremes and yeah, it's good to know that someone out there is keeping their skills sharp while I sit comfy at home. Painfully loud ? Get a life. I'm betting the Toronto Indy irks you too. There's a simple solution. Don't like it ? Go up north for the long weekend, leave town, put some ear plugs in. The air show gets less impressive and speeds are limited because of one or two people, who obviously have nothing better to do than make phone calls and write complaint letters. Sheesh. You know what I hate? Online comments and their venom fueled, marginal, button smashing authors. I've now contributed to this very thing I hate. I'm going to cut my dick off. You should all do the same or similar. I live near the Lakeshore and this morning a CF18 (I think) made a few passes over my house. The noise was visceral... you could feel the sound in your body. I loved it! There's a fundamental excitement to witnessing something so big moving so fast. If supersonic jets flew overhead everyday, it would be annoying. Once a year, it's fun. Heck, traffic noise, construction noise and my neighbour watching movies at midnight with his cheap home theater subwoofer thumping are waaaaaay more annoying than the Air Show ever will be. Exactly! Some of the comments here are hilarious, it's amazing how little it takes to amuse some people. Grown men acting like little boys impressed by shiny objects in the sky. Don't worry, we won't take away your precious air show! lol It is quite challenging to be a pilot of one of those aircraft. Many aircraft in our 'arsenal' are used to such things as Search/Rescue and relief flights. I think that if you take a small step back and admire the people for following their dreams and being tested every day and every flight, it sets a good example of what someone can achieve. Sometimes it is easier to hate on others' accomplishments.... I was on the gardiner this afternoon and got to see them do practice runs. It almost caused a couple accidents because everyone wasn't paying attention to the road. It's prob gonna blow this year because there will be no American planes. All your going to see are those whack ass Canadian snowbirds. I think a few of you misunderstand what supersonic entails. You don't hear anything...until you hear bangs(no roars or screeching)...much after your observation visually. The Shuttle on re-entry descent experiences two booms..even unassisted flight (no engines). For condensation on the surfaces...look up the Prandtl-Glauert singularity. Planes are flyin overhead, they circlin around. THe Airshow is on - this town is about to get down! Light it! Spark it! Bring it! Bring the Bong! Everyone get together and get along. Watch the birds, do their flips, the sound rips through you like Dirt MCGirt! I work nights. When I woke up this morning in Parkdale to the sonic boom, I was feeling a little cranky about it. Then I walked down to Sunnyside and watched them practice. It was breath taking. Yes, the noise makes it difficult to sleep. Yes, it is very distracting (try having a conversation when eight jets are breaking the sound barrier.) But it was very beautiful and thrilling to watch them soar overhead. It's a part of life in the core and it's only for a few days. Love the airshow. Every minute the pilots are in their cockpits is part of ongoing training, we just get to watch them during the airshow. If you want to declare war on noise how about starting with the Harleys? From as far back as I can remember, I've been fasinated with aircraft and war planes. With that said, I don't agree that the air show should be held so close to residential areas. My girlfriend and I live very close to the action and we have 4 cats. When we weren't expecting the extremely loud noise, it REALLY scared us and the cats probably had heart attacks. One day a few months ago, we were walking downtown without a care in the world and all of a sudden, ssshhccrrrrr!!! We almost hit the deck and I don't think anything could scare us more! My girlfriend still has anxiety from those things and I worriedly wonder about our four loving cats and how they feel about it all. Wow, gotta love the morons in the city of gangs,guns and bedbugs and yes allot of people are getting out of Toronto, it is a place called Alberta and of the silence of the Rockies and nature something you morons in the filthy landfill site named Toronto will never understand. sorry but Ontario and Toronto is losing it's most brightest and educated people to the West... so little one you stay in the 10 dollar Province or show some intelligents once in your life and go West young moron. You f*cking retards that move to the big city just f*cking kill me. Move in, then complain and try to change everything to suit your f*cking agenda. Retards. Every year, there is an air show. So, f*ck U, suck it up or go back to where the F*CK your scanky a$$es came from. Ewwwh, too much noise. F*ck off and die. Why don't you try some choice f*cking property near a golf course. Then, you can complain your retard a$$ off about the lawn mowers in the morning waking you up. Dude are u aware of the saying, ( there is one in every crowd?) Well thats is you they are talking about. Please get yourself on happy pills bro, you need them. Children love the air show. dz, loved the ice cream shot at this idot..haha cudos to u. I read your comment.. It is a joke right? It has to be. No one is that much of a moron that thinks we should cancel the air show as it scares your CATS..REALLY MAN!!!COME ON!!! Why don't you find a nice quiet retirement home up north for your girl friend and her nervous pussy... I think, as an Englishman who visits Toronto regularly, that you may possibly have it too good. I am, regardless of that, happy that your lives are so cushy that this is a subject for passionate debate. Just remember all - this isn't really for the adults, it's for the children and they still love the airshow. It's only 3 days for a couple of hours and the kids enjoy it. They haven't seen it repeatedly like some of you. :) The CNE Airshow is so lame nowdays. I am 44 absolutely love jets and aircraft, and it was a ritual going to it every year since i was old enough to walk. I went to every one all 3 days (4 days in the old days) of every years show. But in the last 20 years each successive year it gets lamer and lamer. Due to budget cuts, changes in laws on how low/close to land they can go, etc.. There are way fewer acts now, and many of the best jets of all time are long gone and retired (the SR71 Blackbird. The Avro Vulcan, The Concorde). I remember years when you had more than 4 jet acrobatic teams in one show! The Snowbirds, The US Thunderbirds, The Blue Angels, The Italian Team.. as well as all the big jets and bombers like the B1, the F117 Stealth Bomber, F22 Raptors. Even the space shuttle came one year on the back of it's 747 mothership! But in 2012 we get only two... that's 2!!! modern jets, in the entire show!. One Canadian forces CF18, and one F16 from the US. That's it! the rest is old pre 1960's jets. Old WWII and WWI bi-planes and other propeller craft, which is a total bore to 90% of the people at the show. Whenever you are at the grandstand watching and the propeller planes come in thats when you see everyone heading to the washrooms or to get food, take a hint organizers! Because they are BORING! The snowbirds put on a good show, but they are planes that were built in the 1950's! and they are just little tutor jets. The entire team of 9 planes make less noise than one modern jet. The Blue Angels fly F18's in formation, far more impressive. I won't be going this year, or probably ever again. All the excitement is gone. Actually their practice range takes them over suburban neighborhoods out toward Mississagua, over the Humber Bay area, which isn't urban at all - and the planes fly very close to the tops of peoples' homes for several days in a row. Which isn't to say I'd want to get rid of the show, I think it's fine and rather neat - but it would be nice if they changed their practice area rather than having it over the same neighborhood every year. The only way those planes scare u is if you are use to being in a hut in Al Qaeda country...it is a couple days a year and it shows how far we have come... I wish they would fly a few drones over to us How really far we come lol These comments from some people are really gross. The Snowbirds and biplanes are cool, but the pro war fighter jets have no right flying so low over populated areas. They should not be taking even the remote chance of crashing by flying over the city (and they do crash, as one did just this weekend in the Iowa). I know I'll be called names by some small minded pro war freaks...so take your best shot. Its what I believe. just came back from the airshow. Must say it was one of th boring air show in recent time. Remember a few years back when a screaming jet would fly over the CNe ground every other minute. This year, it was just a few planes flying over and doing the same tricks over and over. My kids wanted to go home coz it was so boring. It's really a sign of time. The Snowbirds put on a fantastic show, the CF-18 is impressive. Melissa Pemberton and the Lucas Oil guy are great (but they fly in the sun so they're invisible to anyone who wants to leave with some sight.) Harvards .... ho hum. Having paid to attend and having been lied to by the organisers (no F-16 or Griffon ...) it was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. Given the budget cuts, I'd rather see one proper airshow every three years than this lame, lame, lame excuse for one. Not what it used to be. Should be called the Etobicoke air show because the majority of the time the planes were over there. Went to the Tor. Island to watch it. Thank you Snowbirds for flying over my head otherwise it was a waste of time. Give me the old days. The Airshow has been a staple in this city since before the war. You complaining bitches made your compromises when you moved into the city. Don't like the noise. Then don't let the door hit yo in the ass on the way out. You whining clowns won't be missed. The airshow isn't going anywhere. There are FAR more of us than there are of you. Wow, people love to get offended. If someone's complaining about the airshow noise, why is it necessary to tell them to move? Or tell them to deal with it? Or to go away from the weekend? Or tell them that's a decision they made when they moved to the city (what if they didn't). People need to stop thinking in black and white, and need to stop holding on to "tradition so much. The airshow is noisy. I've worked 72hrs a wk for the past 3 wks, and this weekend I'm at home resting because I believe I deserve it. To feel like I'm in war-torn Iraq for 3 hours/day for 3 days is not necessary. I feel like if it happened just once that could be excusable, it's just one day. But it was the whole weekend. Where is the compromise? How do you reconcile the two? Families, plane enthusiasts love the air shows. Some residents are terribly irritated by the noise. Instead of being vicious to each other, how about someone toss in some possible solutions to make both parties happy, because I believe it's possible. This is not America, we don't have to be limited to just the 2 choices. -Why celebrate and glorify war machines? We aren't necessarily celebrating machines of war, it's more about the awe of engineering/technological marvels of flight. Especially since we, as regular citizens, rarely see such things. Plus, these "war machines" perform more Search & Rescue missions than they do bombings. -It's a waste of money, fuel, and damaging to the environment! It brings in more money (ie: tourism) than is spent. As for the fuel/environment, it's minute relative to every other mode of major mechanical transportation. -It's too loud! I and my dog/cat get extremely frightended by the noise! You can't handle 3 days, for a few hours at a time, of noise? You live in Toronto, expect disruptions of all kinds. Airplanes at Pearson are much louder, especially giant airbuses. As for you dog/cat, your vacuum scares them more, and I'm pretty sure it makes many more appearances than the air show. -People escaped their war-torn countries where fighter jets bombed/killed constantly, only to see them again here. The difference being, they know they're not being bombed/killed by the fighter jets at the Toronto Air Show here in Canada. -It's extremely dangerous! There have been many crashes! 16 crashes in 60 years. In all of Canada. Not all resulted in fatalities. The last Toronto air show crash was in 1995. " Sure it's noisy, then again everything is. For a few hours once a year it's not a big deal. I wish it were noisier. I'd love to hear those planes break the sound barrier. Who gets excited by planes still ? Me. I love the physics, the extremes and yeah, it's good to know that someone out there is keeping their skills sharp while I sit comfy at home. Painfully loud ? Get a life. I'm betting the Toronto Indy irks you too. There's a simple solution. Don't like it ? Go up north for the long weekend, leave town, put some ear plugs in. The air show gets less impressive and speeds are limited because of one or two people, who obviously have nothing better to do than make phone calls and write complaint letters. Sheesh. " It was Mike, who made this comment, that I was replying to. People like SG and GZ simply don't get the full complexity of life, oversimplifying everything to suit their brains. ;-( I am at the show now. I have been here the past few years. Its a fun event. The only suggestions I would have to improve the event would be to have a more detailed shedule. It would also be nice if someone was keeping all of the jerks in their suvs from parking on the grass infront of old couples and kids that have been waiting patiently for hours. The CNE (Canadian Nauseating Exibition) is one huge rip-off. The only thing worth while is the air show. If there is one thing about the air show I would scrap, is the Snow Birds, my god, same garbage every-year. The CNE has worn out it's welcome. however, every year suckers keep going. The CNE is similar to Toronto, one huge toxic waste site. At the same, rid the city of the TTC (Toronto Trash Commission) Never in my life have I seen such a toxic waste land as Toronto; rude ignorant species, where the average IQ rarely sores above 80. It is very difficult to find one positive entity about Toronto. I know many of the intellects low in intelligence will take offence to this, and I hope they do because they will prove my point. Hey it's one of the only things Toronto has going for it . The jays suck The leafs are only for the rich and company's. Of course there's the jackass parade and lots of unneeded construction were no one seems to be working and the government doesn't seem to care. So the trained all year for one weekend should be given a little high five and why don't you wine about anythings go text message In front of a bus To stop Toronto from being a Metropolis: 1. Shut down CNE - Put up a community shared garden. 2. Add 30 or 40 more condos on the property. 3. Add restaurants that do not serve alcohol. 4. Close down all bars. 5. Close the dome and the CN Tower. 6. Close down all low income housing, coops, shelters and any other social program/utility that helps the less fortunate. 7. Heck, close the hospitals/walk-in clinics and just have nurse practitioners/doctors going on call. 8. Make everything privatized because only the rich and fortunate should be able to live a quiet life in a METROPOLIS! 9. Any kind of recreational/professional sport should be abolished to silence the crowds and any negative behaviours associated to drinking, losing or winning a game or just having fun. 10. Put up some chess/checker boards everywhere because this is clearly only an intellectual city where smoking, drinking alcohol, having fun, playing sports or board games, watching tv/movies, having the volume up, talking loudly, being passionate, singing, dancing, sharing cultural ideas and customs, celebrating, arguing, debating, being blissfully happy, driving a car, eating a burger, not eating completely and utterly healthy at all times and to always be aware of everything you do or say at all times in case some one intellectualizes what your doing to death. Toronto does not want to be New York. Toronto does not want to be Honk Kong. Toronto does not want to be Amsterdam. Toronto does not want to let anyone be themselves without bullying them back to their homes and into their books to read by dim lit candles while sniffing their own freshly baked bread to the sound of Glenn Gould and going to bed at 8:30 pm because that is what good people do...because that is what good people do...and if you deviate from that norm...step back because the intellectual will analyze you and criticize you and win. You will never beat an intellectual in an argument because they spend their life convincing others of their joy to live in only one fashion...intellectualizing themselves. Oh ya...this is about the Air Show. So be it. I'm not an Air Show enthusiast but I've met some really swell folk that fought wars in them planes and them peoples saved lives. I reckon those folks deserves medals because I sure don't know nothing about flyin' those big rigs in the skies. In fact, some of those wonderful folks have been around the world and back and lived the lives of 20 of us folk through war and famine...geez Some told me tells about watchin' their buddies crash landing. Some told me they didn't even want to fight but had too...and ya, some of these folks were smart too...intellectual even... I'm not big on war myself...but who is...this is an Air Show... SHOW...SHOW In fact, some of these intellectual folks were Snipers. The last thing on their mind was to be MACHO. They were scared to the point of peeing their pants while at war. Some of the folks that come to the Air Show opened up to me and showed their tears...they told me they came every year in hopes to see old pals...old buddies...and sometimes...sometimes they met them...they found out after 40 years that their buddy was alive...All sorts of vets from different wars come to check on each other there...and ya they don't like the macho type that show up either...I've read books by candle light and listened to Glenn Gould...heck, even gots meself a degree or two...but, I don't cuss out others in public or hurt their feelings...and if I did...I'd apologize for it....maybe...maybe Toronto should follow up the Air Show with a Hot Air Balloon Festival! Maybe that's quieter and less evasive for those trying to get through the last page of Don Quixote while listening to the soundtrack of the last ballet as their nanny sings their 10 year olds to sleep. Just another stereotype...haha. Sorry, Yodel, but perhaps they don't want their kids to know or care about war planes, or serve in any air force or be involved in any future war? Ever thought about that? Also, have any of you people ever thought about the refugees who come from war-torn nations who can't stand the sound a jet makes due to experiences of being on the receiving end of a jet's cannon or bombs? This was already mentioned by one recent refugee two years ago on why she wanted the Air Show to stop. As it is, it's time for the CNE to go, anyway, to be replaced by something else, as was mentioned in an article in EYE Weekly around 2005. Let the land and buildings be used for events like art and food fairs, as was suggested in the article. "Also, have any of you people ever thought about the refugees who come from war-torn nations who can't stand the sound a jet makes due to experiences of being on the receiving end of a jet's cannon or bombs?" Respectfully, I have to point a few things out. No bombs go off during the air show. Nobody fires the cannons. Moreover, very few refugees these days come from conflicts where jets are used (jets are a first-world game). They come from places where militants travel in helicopters, or Toyota pickups with AK-47s. There, the scariest sound in the world is not an F-18's afterburners, it's a knock on the door in the middle of the night. Uh, I think Spike meant jets from "first-world" countries bombing people in poor countries. That's what planes like these are actually used for. And, by the way, the US military considers a militant to be any "military-age" male in a strike zone. So when you read that a drone killed x number of militants (itself illegal) remember that the militants are often just civilians in the wrong place at the wrong time. So? They're refugees. We took them in, gave them shelter, medical aid, and a chance at a new life in a great country. You really think they care about an airshow that happens one weekend once a year? Stop using other people for yourself. You don't like the airshow, deal with it, but don't pretend you're fighting it for other people. To everyone that moved to the city to be close to everything, but complains about the noise: Move out of the city. Cities are loud, noisy, smelly, etc. because there are so many people in them doing so many different things. Stop expecting everyone else to conform to what you want and loosen up. You might just find you actually have some fun. Excuse me, but I'm not interested in hearing self-entitled arrogant neocon redneck First Worlders like yourself put down people who've suffered due to war and famine. They've gone through true hell which neocon jackasses like you have NEVER endured, and (hopefully) won't ever do so; PTSD, loss of homes, friends, family, self, and livelihoods; emotional trauma, and any other psychological disorders covered in the DSM. What fracking right have you to say that they shouldn't be speaking out about this or telling them to move out of Toronto if they don't like it or tolerate it? They're Torontonians and Canadians, and they pay taxes and work just like you do (although they probably aren't as brainwashed by the Toronto Sun, Faux Noise, or Sun News Channel like you obviously are.) Speaking of Faux Noise, The Toronto Sun, and Sun News Channel, why the frack don't you turn off both channels, and stop reading the paper? All you're doing is letting yourself be brainwashed and made stupid, as your ignorant comments obviously have shown. Haha, I've never been called a neocon before(left wing pinko, but never neocon), guess I hit a nerve there, eh? Funny how people who can't think up a valid counter argument resort to name calling. You never addressed my point of you assuming you were the voice of all refugees in speaking out about the air show. You mention one refugee complaining, but one person doesn't speak for everyone. I'm a native born Canadian, does that mean what I think is what every native Canadian thinks? People are individuals dude, they can think for themselves. Yes, refugees should be grateful, and I imagine the vast majority are. I am incredibly grateful to be born in Canada (especially since I'm a girl and it totally sucks for girls in most of the world). Everyone who lives here should be grateful, it's an awesome country. One of the reasons it is awesome is because people here are generally respectful of each other (internet message boards notwishstanding) and they understand that the entire world should not conform to their wishes. I'm scared of dogs, but do you think I whine and complain about people living with dogs in my building? No, because I'm not a selfish jerk. If someone with a dog goes in the elevator when I want to go in too I just take the stairs instead. Because it is my problem, not their's, so it's my responsibility to deal with it. If you're scared of planes then you should leave Toronto during the airshow, because the majority of Torontonians enjoy it (the Star poll was 80-90% in favour if I'm remembering correctly) and the entire city should not have to inconvenience itself for you. I'm curious actually, what is Faux Noise? Is that the Quebecor paper in Montreal or something? I just assumed they were all called [city name] Sun. You wrote: "I read Spike's comment again, and I am pretty sure you are putting you own spin on it. There's nothing there to suggest what you say." Spike had written: "..have any of you people ever thought about the refugees who come from war-torn nations who can't stand the sound a jet makes due to experiences of being on the receiving end of a jet's cannon or bombs?" I don't know how much clearer you need it to be. I think you're the one putting your own spin on it. Look, if you like the air show, fine. But let's not kid ourselves that this is about nothing more than admiring the beauty of synchronized flying. Fun for the whole family. In the real world, those planes do a lot of harm that we in the West don't see. We can choose to blind ourselves by accepting the narrative of corporate news media (whether the Sun, Star, Globe, or Post), or we can open our eyes and try to understand what's really going on and whose interests are being served. Oh by the way, if you've never heard of people being threatened by jet fighters or being traumatized by them I suggest you speak to some refugees before you just brush off what they've gone through, okay? As for being what you say you are-I'll believe that when you do show some compassion for somebody who's gone through a war on the receiving end instead of the FYIGM (Fuck You, I Got Mine) attitude. Toronto street sign typologies Midland Park would love to brand our neighbourhood as others have done with the custom street signs. looking for suggestions on the best approach or how to fund this.

OP	A common prejudice about Seb Coe is that he was a brilliant Olympian who morphed into a Tory Boy, sucking up to power. This autobiography affirms him as a man of the people rather than a son of privilege. No living Briton has covered so much social ground, from runner-geek to Conservative apparatchik to messianic transformer of London at the triumphant 2012 Games. By any measure, Coe's life is cinematic. London 2012 was not his work alone, but he was its guiding spirit. It provided the political stage denied to him by the grubbiness of Westminster and the shambles of William Hague-era Conservatism If the reader risks backache picking up all the names Coe drops, it is because he has always gravitated towards high office. His apparent poshness is an illusion. In a passage probably designed to correct a myth or two, Coe describes his grandmother Violet as "a true cockney" and great-grandfather Harry Newbold as a professional gambler. His father, Peter, who oversaw his athletic rise, was a communist sympathiser who joined the Merchant Navy to avoid swearing allegiance to the Crown. When Coe failed the 11-plus, Peter declined to spoon out fees and sent him to Hugh Clopton Secondary Modern in Warwickshire. Coe writes: "If I had ended up at a third-rate public school I would never have gone on to do what I've done." His battle against the elements after the family moved to Sheffield is rousing and atmospheric. His own Olympic flame was ignited by David Hemery winning gold and Sheffield's John Sherwood taking bronze in the 400m hurdles at Mexico in 1968. At Sherwood's homecoming, Coe thought: "That could be me." Related Articles He found his vital athletic counterpoint in Steve Ovett, who upset the odds by winning 800m gold in Moscow: a defeat Coe avenged in the 1500m. "The truth is that for one of the very few occasions in my life, I was afraid," Coe writes of the Moscow 800m. The win that followed was his great catharsis. Early political awareness was expressed in a boyhood scrapbook of newspaper cuttings. He was radicalised by the three-day week of the Seventies and what he calls the "drudgery of municipal socialism" in Sheffield, yet sympathised with the striking miners, on whose union tracks he had run: "I remember being at a party once, full of just the kind of braying Sloanes I loathed. The conversation turned to how great it was watching the miners getting hammered every night on the news. 'You have no idea what life in these communities is like, have you? No idea.' And I left." These egalitarian instincts underpinned his Olympic mission. They also lent him common cause with Hague, who made him his chief of staff and judo partner. "We were hewn from the same South Yorkshire landscape," Coe explains. He is a good anecdotalist. The best of his political yarns is his long war against a red-top "Krusty the Clown" (from The Simpsons ) who had been stalking Hague at photo-ops. The pair finished up wrestling on the ground at a seaside resort. Krusty finally gasped: "OK, That's it. I'm not doing this anymore. I'm not paid enough." An extra-marital affair is confessed to and Coe is unbeatable on the dark politics of bidding. Much chortling has accompanied the revelation that Cherie Blair rounded on Jacques Chirac for his dismissive comment about British cooking. "She was at him like a banshee and he couldn't get out of that building fast enough," Coe writes. Her husband tells him: "The thing about my wife is that when she says something, she really means it." In the doomed 2018 World Cup bidding race, Fifa's president Sepp Blatter instructs our author: "Your game is run by idiots." Without Coe there would have been no London 2012. His marshalling of the bid was decisive and his political nous cleared a path through the thickets of media negativity. In his closing speech he cited a consultant anaesthetist at St Mary's Paddington who had worked on the night of the 7/7 bombings as well as at the Games. He told Coe: "For me this is closure. I have seen the worst of mankind and now I've seen the best of mankind." The teller of this tale had climbed his political Olympus.
ID	senorpow Comment 1 27 Oct 2011, 1:53 PM Activating dead spaces is definitely a winner but you have to be careful. It is so important to allow laneways and spaces to develop their own character without too much interference or manipulation. Yeah sure, improve the streetscape, lighting etc. but don't go overboard or you'll ruin it. I'm thinking of Melbourne's laneways, the ones that MCC has allowed to be 'developed' are just plain boring and sterile. The businesses that set up in them and how they're used also reflect this. You walk straight through most of them. The ones everyone flocks to have their own character because they grew organically over time from disused spaces. If you could identify disused building spaces within the city and work with building owners to create options for small businesses (cafes, bars, restaurants, shops, galleries) to lease spaces for reasonable rents then the laneways and spaces will start to create themselves. Zakalwe Comment 1.1 27 Oct 2011, 6:06 PM I completely agree. Culture is never a top down process, Governments can't just create it by committee, you have to set up conditions that allow people to be creative with their lives and spaces. Thats what makes a interesting and living city. Oops, blank comment. Please try again. mark07 Comment 1.2 22 Nov 2011, 11:23 PM I agree with Senorpow comment about identifying disused building and filled with small businesses. One spot that I know that already having this kind of vibe is that small alley near Ivy in the city. Im not sure if Marivale (the company that owned Ivy) owned the building (since I noticed there are two restaurants that belong to them), but the alley has two restaurants, and pop up gallery if im not mistaken, and if you walk a bit along the alley theres a small theatre as well. Would be great if there are more alleys like this, one disused building shared by multiple small businesses. Competition might be hard, but at least it will create a vibrant inner city, plus it will push small business owners to be more creative. Oops, blank comment.

Zakalwe Comment 2.1 27 Oct 2011, 6:03 PM Great idea. I used to go to The Majestic in Petersham all the time. Such great social interaction. And you dont realise your exercising. ;-) Oops, blank comment.

I'd love to see this become a summer event, with places like Martin Place or Hyde Park being used. Our parks are perfect spaces for use at night. The night noodle markets are fabulous but too short lived - for only two weeks Hyde Park becomes a vibrant town in itself. Night farmers markets maybe? Night bar festivals as well as restaurant festivals? Let bars like Eau de vie, Shady Pines, Grandmas, more... Oops, blank comment. Please try again. Frank Comment 4 30 Oct 2011, 1:43 PM encourage creative lighting - yes ! with the recent growth in LED colour strips lighting (see World Square both outside and inside the George/Goulburn St corner), there is now tremendous opportunity for highlighting interest. Suggest offering $1000 or so as a competition prize to each design college for LED color strips (green/energy efficient) - with naming rights for aspiring artists (like the beerline currently between Paddy's Market and the Entertainment Centre) so they can compete for the most impressive public art installation to be placed on a relatively permanent basis - (not so much temporary-only please - it feels too much like wasted money) - perhaps like 'your college and the design student can have your name attached to this art work as long as you maintain it, else it gets removed' Oops, blank comment. Please try again. earlyeast Comment 5 30 Oct 2011, 3:59 PM Additional lighting in the city would be a tremendous improvement! Particularly buildings that have such beautiful architecture, such as the QVB and the old General Post Office in Martin Place. However, it needs to be extremely tastefully thought out, otherwise it could end up appearing 'tacky' - and that's the last thing we need in Sydney! Oops, blank comment. Please try again. admin Comment 6 31 Oct 2011, 12:01 PM In New York City's Times Square, as other studies have shown, providing free moveable park/public seating allows individuals and groups to naturally gather, assemble, form, congregate, partcipate or sit alone as they choose, while enjoying the comings and goings and passersby with pleasure. As well as the moveable tables/chairs, the rising steps seating also generates a great amphitheatre feeling - of being both spectator and part of the spectacle at the same time - viewed and viewer - more... admin Comment 6.1 31 Oct 2011, 12:02 PM THIS REPLY FROM Earlyeast Disappointed to hear in the previous comment, that Woolworths Town Hall lease has been renewed for up to 20 years. I thought the new proposed square "in front of" Sydney Town Hall, would have been the 'icing on the cake' for this city! Oops, blank comment. Please try again. senorpow Comment 7 6 Nov 2011, 5:44 PM Change the traffic signals to improve the flow of pedestrians in the city, even if it's just outside of peak hours. It just isn't pedestrian friendly at the moment. Walking around the Sydney CBD can be downright hostile with the pace of the traffic light changes. Running to make the walk sign in the very, very few seconds allotted isn't conducive to ambling along, exploring and discovering laneways. It makes people rush and you don't really get the chance to relax, discover or enjoy anything. You should also be able to push the walk button after the change and get a green walk sign if it's safe and there's enough time to cross before the next light change. You can't do that either and pedestrians just cut through traffic, in front of buses and everything else because the amount of time you have to wait is too long. If people were given a realistic amount of time to wait and then to cross, it might actually reduce jaywalking and pedestrian injuries as a result and encourage people to relax a bit and explore their environment. There's actually lots to take in and enjoy, even if you are a local. Oops, blank comment. Please try again. Reece Comment 8 7 Nov 2011, 12:26 AM More simple unobtrusive signage directing people to not just landmarks but nightlife areas - say for example Kings Cross, George Street, Oxford Street, Surry Hills, etc - is a very cost effective & useful strategy to bring people into these areas. It is done decently in amsterdam and it just makes it easier to explore the place without worrying about staying on the main streets. I have met many overseas people on my travels who have been to sydney for a weekend or two and who havent ventured from george st cause they just didn't know where to go out clubbing or to find small bars. Cityboy Comment 8.1 9 Nov 2011, 12:08 PM The last thing we want to do is bring even MORE people into these areas that are already so packed with drunk people every night Oops, blank comment. Please try again. Cityboy Comment 9 17 Nov 2011, 2:04 PM I think cleaning streets more frequently should be a priority. Particularly in areas with large amounts of late night 'revellers' such as Kings Cross, Oxford Street and George Street. However it's not enough just to clean it the next day. It would be far more effective if there were roving cleaners throughout the night on these streets. That way you wouldn't have all the rubbish and vomit etc. sitting around on the footpath until the next morning. When an area is filthy (as these areas currently are late at night) it encourages more people to disrespect the area and drop their rubbish on the street, because everyone else is doing it. Alternatively, Council could strictly enforce the conditions of consent for the licensed venues and fast food shops and ensure these businesses keep the footpath in front of their premises clean and free of litter. This is a requirement listed in the conditions of consent for most of these businesses, but it is rarely upheld or enforced Oops, blank comment. Please try again. Surry Comment 10 22 Nov 2011, 11:01 PM Creative lighting would help make areas of the city feel more alive at night, and therefore safer. It would also encourage more tourists to sightsee at night, creating a greater demand for more services and places to eat. It would also help if streets in particularly busy night areas were closed to general traffic, with just public transport and taxis allowed. Perhaps then, we could use part of the road for food trucks, vendors, buskers etc who provide more diversity to the street. And as a resident of Surry Hills who lives a block from Oxford St... I am one of the regular club/pubgoers on the strip, but I am walking through filth every time - overflowing rubbish bins, vomit, spilt drinks etc. This filthy environment encourages further disrespect by visitors. And you need to focus not just on the main street. Pelican St, for example, has this filth all the way down to Goulburn, as people veer off the main strip

Book Description 'One of the most compelling and influential works of English literature in the last century' - Independent --This text refers to an alternate Paperback edition. Some readers seem to have difficulty with this short novel. It's certainly not easy reading (Conrad never is, though I love his prose style), but is a challenging, thought-provoking and highly absorbing character study. The journey is as much into a mind breaking down as it is a physical journey down the Congo River. I found it richly rewarding (both the 1st time and when I read it again recently). It probably says more, in a short space, than any other novel about human existence, civilization and human excesses (with the possible exception of "The Fall" by Albert Camus). Powerful stuff - if you like a strong poison then try it (and then check out Conrad's great full-length novels: "Lord Jim", "Nostromo" and "Under Western Eyes"). This review is specifically about the Kindle edition of The Heart of Darkness, and more specifically: # Publisher: Public Domain Books (9 Jan 2006) # Sold by: Amazon Media EU S. r.l. # ASIN: B000JQU7A8 Reviews between editions seem to be frequently amalgamated and so it is important to note this is about the free (at time of writing) version. Please also note that this review is about the 'edition', not the actual story itself and is therefore no reflection on Conrad's writing. Having made myself clear on what I am reviewing (hopefully!) then my opinion is this: Download some samples of other versions and pay some small amount for a better text. I struggled with half of this version before resorting to the actual book that I already owned. There are two major problems: 1. The style of writing and the protagonist Marlow's delivery makes very frequent use of dashes (en or em rules). This Kindle edition uses double hyphens, viz --, with no spaces, as in 'There were cases of them down at the coast--cases--piled up--burst--split!', which makes reading awkward and detracts from the narrative style. 2. Carriage returns are used frequently in error and seemingly at random. It is possible to identify new paragraphs as they are correctly indented but, having a line finishing after the first word for example, implies the end of a paragraph. However, the non-indented start of the next line shows that the text was meant to be continuous. Checking several examples with the Penguin text edition shows that these frequent carriage returns are, indeed, in error. With this novella Joseph Conrad brutally rips away the barriers that men build to hide themselves and exposes the evil that lurks in all men's hearts, waiting for an opportunity to get out.kurtz sails away into the dark continent full of ambition to build a bright shining society where men will be Gods. The result is unspeakable evil. What actually happens the reader never knows. They are just invited to look at the battered result of Kurtz's ambition. Marlowe returns and visits the now dead Kurt's fiancee, but is unable to tell her the truth about her beloved and makes up some romantic tale to spare her feelings. Nowadays Conrad is vulnerable to accusations of racism as he uses Africa to represent the dark continent. As always the politically correct have completely missed the pooint. The evil was in Kurtz, as it is in all men, not in Africa. And Conrad was exposing the wickednesss of colonolism which he was vehemently against, which anyone could find out if they read his works closely. In fact he was not a racist but years ahead of his time.
OP	Returning Tools To Sears Should Not Be This Complicated Oh, Sears. They sort of want to become a modern retailer, but don't know how. They just can't figure out this whole 21st-century retail thing. E-mail reminders? Returning items online that were purchased online? Too confusing. Too modern. Make it go away. Jim is the rare Consumerist reader who has no complaints about Sears, even though he actually shops there. But even he admits that his recent experience returning some Craftsman tools was needlessly complicated and required a lot more steps than it should have. I've shopped at Sears for a number of years, despite all of The Consumerist's horror stories. I really haven't had any trouble with them. Including in this anecdote -- they did do everything right eventually, it was just a very circuitous process. I got it in my head that I wanted to do more woodworking, and so I bought myself a table saw and a drill press. The drill press was in stock locally, so I picked it up. The table saw was not, and I had it shipped. It arrived without issue 2 days later. No problems. Fast forward a month and they're still sitting in the box, and I have some buyer's remorse. Clearly I haven't used the tools yet, and they did cost a lot, and maybe I get can by with some cheaper options. Back to the store they go. Easy enough, I thought -- just go to the website and fill out that I wanted to return them. No dice. Return could not be processed, please call customer service. I hate talking to people. On a whim, since I picked up one item and shipped the other, I tried doing them separately. Voila! Processed separately, so now I had two return receipts. Annoying, but not a big deal. Off to the store I go. I cart in the items and scan my first barcode and...nothing. It won't acknowledge the barcode. Same on the other order. Okay, there are other ways to look it up. I scan my credit card, and lo! It finds them. Well, one of them. it finds the drill press. I return that. The clerk comes out to pick it up and I explain that I actually have two things and question what to do. He tells me that the barcode on my sheet is just a sample code, for some reason and suggests I look up by phone number. No good, still only finds items I picked up in store. I think to try looking up by order number, and find it in very very small type on the receipt. Success! It finds the other order, the guy rings it up for me and says he'll be right back with the receipt. He hands me one for the table saw, and directs me inside to get credit for the press. Pardon? Apparently, it needed to be punched into a cash register in the store. Into the store I trudge, and the employee punches it in and credits my card and I'm off. Whee. A few days later, I get an email telling me that my return is about to expire. This is concerning, since I completed both returns (I thought). I check my statements to verify the money is there. The press is credited back, but not the table saw. The one that I thought was just credited straight to the card. Panic ensues. I dig back through my confirmation emails to find the one for the saw, and in the fine print am told that I will receive my money back via check within 7-10 days. About a week later I receive my refund check. The next day I get another helpful email telling me my return is about to expire. I have no idea what refund they're talking about. So Sears really didn't do anything wrong (other than those extra emails), and all of the clerks were very polite and helpful, and I did get all of my money back. But still. What a lot of hoops to jump through for something that should've been much much simpler. At least this story ends happily, and Jim hasn't sworn off Sears forever. I think that's reserved for appliance purchases.
IN	Navigation The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions. The single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem solving . Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That's why this chapter is called, The way of the program. On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer. The programming language you will be learning is Python. Python is an example of a high-level language ; other high-level languages you might have heard of are C++, PHP, and Java. As you might infer from the name high-level language, there are also low-level languages , sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly languages. Loosely speaking, computers can only execute programs written in low-level languages. Thus, programs written in a high-level language have to be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages. But the advantages are enormous. First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language. Programs written in a high-level language take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. Second, high-level languages are portable , meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run on another. Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level languages. Low-level languages are used only for a few specialized applications. Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages: interpreters and compilers . An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations. A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program starts running. In this case, the high-level program is called the source code , and the translated program is called the object code or the executable . Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation. Many modern languages use both processes. They are first compiled into a lower level language, called byte code , and then interpreted by a program called a virtual machine . Python uses both processes, but because of the way programmers interact with it, it is usually considered an interpreted language. There are two ways to use the Python interpreter: shell mode and script mode . In shell mode, you type Python statements into the Python shell and the interpreter immediately prints the result: The first line of this example is the command that starts the Python interpreter at a Unix command prompt. The next three lines are messages from the interpreter. The fourth line starts with &gt;&gt;&gt; , which is the Python prompt . The interpreter uses the prompt to indicate that it is ready for instructions. We typed print 1 + 1 , and the interpreter replied 2 . Alternatively, you can write a program in a file and use the interpreter to execute the contents of the file. Such a file is called a script . For example, we used a text editor to create a file named firstprogram.py with the following contents: rint 1 + 1 By convention, files that contain Python programs have names that end with .py . To execute the program, we have to tell the interpreter the name of the script: $ python firstprogram.py 2 These examples show Python being run from a Unix command line. In other development environments, the details of executing programs may differ. Also, most programs are more interesting than this one. The examples in this book use both the Python interpreter and scripts. You will be able to tell which is intended since shell mode examples will always start with the Python prompt. Working in shell mode is convenient for testing short bits of code because you get immediate feedback. Think of it as scratch paper used to help you work out problems. Anything longer than a few lines should be put into a script. A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. The computation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such as searching and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program. The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language: Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements. repetition Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation. Believe it or not, that's pretty much all there is to it. Every program you've ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look more or less like these. Thus, we can describe programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with one of these basic instructions. That may be a little vague, but we will come back to this topic later when we talk about algorithms . Programming is a complex process, and because it is done by human beings, it often leads to errors. For whimsical reasons, programming errors are called bugs and the process of tracking them down and correcting them is called debugging . Python can only execute a program if the program is syntactically correct; otherwise, the process fails and returns an error message. syntax refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure. For example, in English, a sentence must begin with a capital letter and end with a period. this sentence contains a syntax error . So does this one For most readers, a few syntax errors are not a significant problem, which is why we can read the poetry of e. e. cummings without spewing error messages. Python is not so forgiving. If there is a single syntax error anywhere in your program, Python will print an error message and quit, and you will not be able to run your program. During the first few weeks of your programming career, you will probably spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors. As you gain experience, though, you will make fewer errors and find them faster. The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the error does not appear until you run the program. These errors are also called exceptions because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened. Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the first few chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one. The third type of error is the semantic error . If there is a semantic error in your program, it will run successfully, in the sense that the computer will not generate any error messages, but it will not do the right thing. It will do something else. Specifically, it will do what you told it to do. The problem is that the program you wrote is not the program you wanted to write. The meaning of the program (its semantics) is wrong. Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to figure out what it is doing. One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging. Although it can be frustrating, debugging is one of the most intellectually rich, challenging, and interesting parts of programming. In some ways, debugging is like detective work. You are confronted with clues, and you have to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see. Debugging is also like an experimental science. Once you have an idea what is going wrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis was correct, then you can predict the result of the modification, and you take a step closer to a working program. If your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one. As Sherlock Holmes pointed out, When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. (A. Conan Doyle, The Sign of Four ) For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That is, programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you want. The idea is that you should start with a program that does something and make small modifications, debugging them as you go, so that you always have a working program. For example, Linux is an operating system kernel that contains millions of lines of code, but it started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds used to explore the Intel 80386 chip. According to Larry Greenfield, one of Linus's earlier projects was a program that would switch between printing AAAA and BBBB. This later evolved to Linux ( The Linux Users' Guide Beta Version 1). Later chapters will make more suggestions about debugging and other programming practices. Natural languages are the languages that people speak, such as English, Spanish, and French. They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally. Formal languages are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a formal language to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly: Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations. Formal languages tend to have strict rules about syntax. For example, 3+3=6 is a syntactically correct mathematical statement, but 3=+6$ is not. H 2 O is a syntactically correct chemical name, but 2 Zz is not. Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to tokens and structure. Tokens are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements. One of the problems with 3=+6$ is that $ is not a legal token in mathematics (at least as far as we know). Similarly, 2 Zz is not legal because there is no element with the abbreviation Zz . The second type of syntax rule pertains to the structure of a statement -- that is, the way the tokens are arranged. The statement 3=+6$ is structurally illegal because you can't place a plus sign immediately after an equal sign. Similarly, molecular formulas have to have subscripts after the element name, not before. When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have to figure out what the structure of the sentence is (although in a natural language you do this subconsciously). This process is called parsing . For example, when you hear the sentence, The other shoe fell, you understand that the other shoe is the subject and fell is the verb. Once you have parsed a sentence, you can figure out what it means, or the semantics of the sentence. Assuming that you know what a shoe is and what it means to fall, you will understand the general implication of this sentence. Although formal and natural languages have many features in common -- tokens, structure, syntax, and semantics -- there are many differences: ambiguity Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning, regardless of context. redundancy In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural languages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal languages are less redundant and more concise. literalness Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. If someone says, The other shoe fell, there is probably no shoe and nothing falling. Formal languages mean exactly what they say. People who grow up speaking a natural language -- everyone -- often have a hard time adjusting to formal languages. In some ways, the difference between formal and natural language is like the difference between poetry and prose, but more so: Poetry Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity is not only common but often deliberate. Prose The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure contributes more meaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous. Programs The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure. Here are some suggestions for reading programs (and other formal languages). First, remember that formal languages are much more dense than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them. Also, the structure is very important, so it is usually not a good idea to read from top to bottom, left to right. Instead, learn to parse the program in your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the structure. Finally, the details matter. Little things like spelling errors and bad punctuation, which you can get away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal language. An intermediate language between source code and object code. Many modern languages first compile source code into byte code and then interpret the byte code with a program called a virtual machine . compile To translate a program written in a high-level language into a low-level language all at once, in preparation for later execution. debugging The process of finding and removing any of the three kinds of programming errors. exception Another name for a runtime error. executable Another name for object code that is ready to be executed. formal language Any one of the languages that people have designed for specific purposes, such as representing mathematical ideas or computer programs; all programming languages are formal languages. igh-level language A programming language like Python that is designed to be easy for humans to read and write. interpret To execute a program in a high-level language by translating it one line at a time. low-level language A programming language that is designed to be easy for a computer to execute; also called machine language or assembly language. natural language Any one of the languages that people speak that evolved naturally. object code The output of the compiler after it translates the program. arse To examine a program and analyze the syntactic structure. ortability A property of a program that can run on more than one kind of computer. rint statement An instruction that causes the Python interpreter to display a value on the screen. roblem solving The process of formulating a problem, finding a solution, and expressing the solution. rogram a sequence of instructions that specifies to a computer actions and computations to be performed. Python shell An interactive user interface to the Python interpreter. The user of a Python shell types commands at the prompt (&gt;&gt;&gt;), and presses the return key to send these commands immediately to the interpreter for processing. runtime error An error that does not occur until the program has started to execute but that prevents the program from continuing. script A program stored in a file (usually one that will be interpreted). semantic error An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the programmer intended. semantics The meaning of a program. source code A program in a high-level language before being compiled. syntax The structure of a program. syntax error An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse -- and therefore impossible to interpret. token One of the basic elements of the syntactic structure of a program, analogous to a word in a natural language. Write an English sentence with understandable semantics but incorrect syntax. Write another English sentence which has correct syntax but has semantic errors. Start a Python shell. Type 1 + 2 and then hit return. Python evaluates this expression , prints the result, and then prints another prompt. * is the multiplication operator , and ** is the exponentiation operator . Experiment by entering different expressions and recording what is printed by the Python interpreter. What happens if you use the / operator? Are the results what you expect? Explain. Type 1 2 and then hit return. Python tries to evaluate the expression, but it can't because the expression is not syntactically legal. Instead, it prints the error message: File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1 1 2 ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax In many cases, Python indicates where the syntax error occurred, but it is not always right, and it doesn't give you much information about what is wrong. So, for the most part, the burden is on you to learn the syntax rules. In this case, Python is complaining because there is no operator between the numbers. See if you can find a few more examples of things that will produce error messages when you enter them at the Python prompt. Write down what you enter at the prompt and the last line of the error message that Python reports back to you. Type print 'hello' . Python executes this statement, which has the effect of printing the letters h-e-l-l-o. Notice that the quotation marks that you used to enclose the string are not part of the output. Now type "hello" and describe your result. Make note of when you see the quotation marks and when you don't. Type print cheese without the quotation marks. The output will look something like this: This is a run-time error; specifically, it is a NameError, and even more specifically, it is an error because the name cheese is not defined. If you don't know what that means yet, you will soon. Type 'This is a test...' at the Python prompt and hit enter. Record what happens. Now create a python script named test1.py with the following contents (be sure to save it before you try to run it): 'This is a test...' What happens when you run this script? Now change the contents to: rint 'This is a test...' and run it again. What happened this time? Whenever an expression is typed at the Python prompt, it is evaluated and the result is printed on the line below. 'This is a test...' is an expression, which evaluates to 'This is a test...' (just like the expression 42 evaluates to 42 ). In a script, however, evaluations of expressions are not sent to the program output, so it is necessary to explicitly print them.
NA	Net migration to UK remains at more than 250,000 a year Theresa May wants to reduce annual net migration to the UK to below 100,000 by the time of the next election. Photograph: David Jones/PA Annual net migration to Britain remains at a record high of more than 250,000 a year despite the declared ambition of the home secretary, Theresa May , to reduce it below 100,000 by the time of the next election, according to figures published on Thursday. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the politically sensitive figure for net migration -- the number of people coming to stay in the UK for longer than 12 months minus the number going to live abroad for more than 12 months -- in the year to September 2011 was 252,000. This is only 3,000 below the 255,000 recorded in the previous year to September 2010 and is a rise of 2,000 from the previous quarter's figure of 250,000 in the year to June 2011. The latest figures are a blow to Home Office ministers, who have put in place new curbs on non-European workers, including an annual cap on skilled migrants and a clampdown on overseas students but have yet to see the net migration figures moving in the direction of their target. Downing Street said the government remained committed to getting net migration down to "tens of thousands". "There is evidence that the changes we are making to the rules are starting to have an impact. It is still our intention to bring the levels of net migration back down to the tens of thousands. Clearly it is going to take some time," said the prime minister's official spokesman. New moves to curb the numbers coming to join close family members and spouses by as much as two-thirds are also expected to be detailed shortly. The ONS said that long-term immigration to the UK remained steady at 589,000 -- a level it has remained at since 2004. An estimated 252,000 people left Britain to the join the 5 million British citizens already living abroad. About 190,000 people left the UK to work abroad. Studying remains the most common reason for coming to live in Britain with 250,000 overseas students arriving in the year to September 2011 -- a similar level to the previous year. The Home Office, however, pointed to the "leading indicator" of more recent data on the number of student visas issued rather than the ONS estimates of student migration which show a 21% fall in overseas students coming to Britain in the year to March 2012. Ministers claim that an apparent 62% fall in the number of student visas between January and March this year shows that a recent drive to curb their numbers is working. The figures also show that the number of people applying for asylum fell slightly to 4,844 in the first three months of 2012, with 706 applicants from Pakistan and 575 from Iran. The number of people detained for immigration reasons in Britain, which is already the highest in Europe, reached new record levels with 7,516 incarcerated in the first three months of this year -- an increase of 7%. They included 53 children, of whom 35 were detained in the new "family-friendly" Cedars pre-departure unit near Gatwick airport. The coalition pledged to put an end to child detention. Ministers will be concerned to see that removals and deportations fell again during the first three months of this year to 13,386, a 6% drop compared with the same period in 2011 and more than 25% down from a peak in 2008 when a major effort was made to deport jailed foreign nationals. The number of people granted settlement in Britain in the year to March 2012 fell by 35% from 226,478 to 148,144 but this was mainly because of a backlog of long-term asylum "legacy" cases moving out of the system. The number of new British citizens also fell by 10% to 175,298. The immigration minister, Damian Green, said the figures show signs of progress: "Our tough new rules are now making a real difference with a record 62% drop in student visas in the first quarter of 2012, and overall falls in work visas, family numbers and people settling. "As these policies start to bite we are seeing an end to the years when net migration was consistently on the rise. But the hangover from the old system of weak controls means it is still too high and we will continue our programme of reforms to bring net migration down from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands." However, the Migration Watch UK chairman, Sir Andrew Green, who campaigns for zero net migration, said "tough measures" were now needed: "You cannot expect to repair 15 years of mismanagement in 15 months, but it is still worrying news that net migration is running at a quarter of a million a year. There is no sign of any reduction from the huge numbers that developed under Labour." Yvette Cooper MP, the shadow home secretary, said the government was failing badly on its own immigration target to reduce net migration: "David Cameron said 12 months ago: 'No ifs. No buts. That's a promise we made to the British people.' Yet these figures show that promise is being broken and the net migration figure of 252,000 is barely changed in the last two years, even with the net rise in British citizens leaving the UK. "Migration experts have said the government does not have the policies to deliver on the target, so the prime minister is not being straight with the public on immigration. He should not make promises he can't keep on such an important policy area," said Cooper.
OP	Country Song of the Week: 'I Can't Stop Loving You' Arguments about what is and isn't country music have gone on ever since the term was invented. Those who argue that Taylor Swift "isn't country" have a point. But it's important to remember that at one time even Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings were seen as gate crashers. All great artists push the envelope; not all those who push the envelope are great artists. Ray Charles was a great artist. In 1962, the singer released "I Can't Stop Loving You" as the first single off his genre-hopping Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music . A stew of gospel, pop, soul, and Nashville polish, the song went on to sell over a million copies. Despite the sensation the tune caused on the charts, it was rejected from country radio. Was country music better for policing its stylistic borders so rigidly? Certainly, it wasn't effective. Ray Charles's soulful channeling of the country songbook become one of the most influential albums in country history.
NA OP	Pages 25 October, 2012 Standardbred Canada, C'Mon Man Remember when the now disgraced and humiliated Minister of Finance Dwight Duncan started spewing lies and half truths about the Ontario horse racing industry in the spring? The way I look at it, if you have to resort to falsities to make your case, it either means your case is weak and you need to lie, or you yourself are ignorant of the facts. I think it was a mixture of the two when Duncan went on his selling of the end of slots at racetracks campaign. I believe the large motivating factor was that he and Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty were sucked in to Paul Godfrey's Toronto casino pitch, and desperate to reduce the deficit, Duncan and McGuinty forgot they were working for the good of the people of Ontario when they made the decision that facts and due diligence weren't important. Duncan stressed that the government couldn't afford to give the racing industry a subsidy any longer, calling the revenues tax dollars. During the 14 years tracks and horsemen received a cut of slots revenue, it was clearly a business partnership, not a subsidy, and definitely the tracks were not receiving tax dollars. Even the OLG in their financial reports referred to monies that went to tracks and horsemen as "commissions." When introduced, the Ontario government was looking for revenue sources, and knowing that slots could easily be introduced at established gambling centers (racetracks), and also knowing that if people voted for slots gambling, the vote would be no in most jurisdictions if done outside a track, a deal was struck. It was also known that cannibalization would occur (the tracks would lose some customers, some of their customers betting dollars, and also lose potential long term customers who would never be nurtured as Horseplayers). Clearly, what we are seeing right now that if referendums (which the Liberal government made "not mandatory") were introduced, there would barely be a casino built in the future outside of a racetrack locale. Even without referendums, the OLG is having a very difficult time selling many towns and cities on the idea of casinos not located at racetracks. I don't think they had a clue it was going to be this tough. I'm sure Godfrey convinced Duncan and McGuinty that expanded gambling outside tracks would be a slam dunk. The reality is that in most instances, the only place a casino is accepted in Ontario is at a racetrack. This fact means that the OLG is reliant on racetracks to keep their revenue streams, and going forward, it means money coming from whatever new deal can hardly be called a subsidy. So what does this have to do with Standardbred Canada? Well, they are using Duncan like tactics when it comes to selling their case. On one point in particular. And that is something I've written about here in the past, the percentage of net revenue that the OLG actually makes, both now, and going forward. My beef with Standardbred Canada is that they perpetuate deceit in stressing that Bingo Halls will receive 47% of gambling revenues going forward, while slots at tracks only resulted in 25% being kept by the tracks, horsemen and municipalities, while also stating that the OLG (the government) made 75% under the old deal. They are blurring the truth in a big way. Bingo halls are to keep 47% of revenues, however, that is after the bingo halls pay the expenses. If you check out page 16 of the OLG Annual Report , you'll find that the OLG pays the expenses at the racetracks for the casino operations, and after they paid these expenses, as well as the 25% the horsemen, tracks and municipalities received, they wound up with around 48-49% net income. Here is the rejected comment. It is completely factual, and Standardbred Canada clearly wants to perpetuate the deceit, so they didn't print it: "Although I agree that the Auditor General should really look into this case, I get tired of seeing the 47% versus 75% case being constantly made. The reality is that after expenses the OLG received around 47-49% net from the Slots at Racetracks Program (thanks to the governments way of overpaying, expenses to run the operations were over 25% on average, which is on par to what they are offering the Bingo Halls right now). The AG should look into the buying of Bingo Halls over the last few years as well as the fact that Bingo Halls have been on a major decline while Slots at Tracks have remained pretty much the same in recent years as far as net income received by the government is concerned. Why the preference to Bingo Halls? And where was the social and economic impact study that should have done before even considering ending the SAR program?" I'm not sure if Mr. Burgess is ignorant when it comes to net incomes or if he just bought into Standardbred Canada's propaganda without thinking about it. It is kind of disturbing that horsemen would be ignorant of these things. Stating the OLG made 75% of slot revenues would be like Dwight Duncan stating that the owner (in harness racing) makes 90% of the purses, overlooking the fact that owners pay day pay, shipping, vets, etc., which in many cases reduces that 90% to a negative number. Anyway, Standardbred Canada deserves the slap. C'mon Man! One last thing. The recommendations by the Racing Panel will be released by OMAFRA very shortly (maybe even tomorrow), and I'm optimistically expecting it to be good for Ontario horse racing and rubber stamped immediately. I think we'll see a some shrinkage, but nowhere near the alleged shrinkage George Costanza experienced when coming out of the pool in a classic Seinfeld episode:)
NA	Time to Take the Wheel on 13 April 2011 . CASC-OR Lays Out a Path to Go Racing We are often asked "How does one get into this?" The question, of course, refers to motorsport and, in particular, road racing. Over the next two issues of PRN we will try to get you up to speed and give you the ABCs on how to get started and what types of cars and opportunities are available to you. The Canadian Automobile Sports Clubs (CASC) provides oversight for Club racing in Ontario and is responsible for everything from Drivers' Schools to the sanctioning of Race Events. A typical season will start with a Drivers' School in April (with a second school in June). This two day event is a prerequisite for obtaining a race licence. Instructors are typically paired with two students, and while one receives classroom instruction the second is on track with an instructor, ensuring maximum one-on-one coaching. So what do you need to take the school? A two-seater manual shift car, an approved helmet and some comfortable shoes - that's it. The month of April also has the first organized test (practices). "Spring Fling" gives competitors the opportunity to shake off the cobwebs after a long winter. Like the CASC Race School, Spring Fling is held at Shannonville Motorsport Park near Belleville, Ontario. The technical nature of this circuit makes it ideal for both driver training and testing. A typical race season consists of eight Regional Events organized by the various automobile clubs and held at venues like Mosport International Raceway, Shannonville Motorsports Park and Calabogie Motorsport Park. Not all race groups attend all eight events -- some race only six weekends and others drop some regionals in order to attend pro events. In part one of the series, we take a look at open-wheel cars also known as purpose-built race cars, classes which have been a favourite of long-standing regional competitors, but are also recognized as the jumping-off point for the budding professional. Formula 1200 (formally known as Formula Vee) is a signal seater car utilizing many components along with an engine from the lovable Volkswagen beetle. The original concept dates back to the late 1950s and has been recognized globally (Canada, USA, Europe, and Australia, to name a few) as a legitimate formula. Married to a purpose-built space frame chassis, the combination of old and new makes for a potent race car while keeping costs down. While the formula's horsepower figures are somewhat modest (57hp), don't be fooled -- these race cars can attain speeds well over 100 mph and can pull 1.5 g's during cornering. Racecraft is the all important key to success, and multiple lead changes are commonplace, with drafting the rule rather than the exception. Arrive and drive rental programs are available, with pricing for new cars in the $10,000 range and pricing for used cars starting at around $7,000. In 1967, Formula Ford was launched in the UK and has proven to be the starting point for many a budding professional, and the Ontario- based OFFC (Ontario Formula Ford Championship) is no different. 2010 Formula Mazda Champion Conor Daly and American Le Mans Series LMPC frontrunner Kyle Marcelli are both graduates of the OFFC. Like the Villeneuves Tracys and Goodyears before them, both are using this iconic formula as a foundation to build a professional career. Catering not only to the young aspirant, the core group of OFFC Drivers are made up of club racers who year after year never seem to tire of the cut and thrust nature of this formula. The Ontario series is split in two classes: "A" for cars 1995 and newer and "B" for 1994 and older cars. Getting started in Class B can be achieved for about $10,000-$15,000 with Class A cars running in the region of $25,000-$40,000. Speciality race shops can handle your every need from replacement parts to full rental rides. As with F1200, the racing is fierce with the emphasis placed on racecraft and set up. It is not uncommon for the race winners to be decided on the last lap. New for 2011 is the Team Canada Scholarship, which provides an opportunity for one talented individual to compete in the seasons' end prestigious Formula Ford Festival in England, which is renowned as a showcase for new talent. The third group we are going to look at is Formula Libre, a bit of a catch-all class for purpose-built race cars. The class structure is based on three groups: Wings and Slicks, Sports Racers, and Other. Wings and Slicks cover all open wheel cars with aerodynamic aids and sticky slick tires; this group also includes the long- standing Formula 4 (F4) class. Based on a 750cc motorcycle engine and weighing only 850 lbs. F4 delivers a big bang from such a small package and, as most of the cars are home-built, the formula is a tinkerers dream. With Professional race series constantly reworking their technical regulations, seemingly obsolete cars are finding their way into the Wings and Slicks category of Libre. These redundant vehicles can be purchased for well under the current market value and are proving to be ultra-competitive. Resembling scaled down Le Mans Prototypes, Sports Racers are the fastest growing category in Libre. These full-bodied single or two-seater prototypes produce a large amount of aerodynamic downforce and it is not uncommon to see them battling with an open-wheel winged formula car for overall positions. As the name implies, "Other" rounds out the Libre grid, and offers a place for everyone else to run, including the recently formed Formula Classic. Cars built from 1971 to 1981 form the core of the Formula Classic grid, and must run in their original configuration. Although driven with as much verve as the rest of the Libre cars, Classics adhere to a tough driver conduct rule, as many of these cars are irreplaceable museum pieces.

IN	AUTOBIO from "Reality Hunger: A Manifesto" to be published by Knopf in January 2010 by David Shields 430 As far as I can recall, the initial shiver of inspiration was somehow prompted by a newspaper story about an ape that, after months of coaxing by a scientist, produced the first drawing ever charcoaled by an animal. This sketch showed the bars of the poor creature?s cage. 431 I wrote a story once, about a man who began a very large picture, and therein was a kind of map?for example, hills, horses, streams, fishes, and woods and towers and men and all sorts of things. When the day of his death came, he found he had been making a picture of himself. That is the case with most writers. 432 In, for example, V.S. Naipaul?s A Way in the World , W.G. Sebald?s The Emigrants , Hilton Als?s The Women , each chapter, when considered singly, is relatively straightforwardly biographical, but when read as a whole, refracts brilliant, harsh light back upon the author. 433 In a larger sense, all writing is autobiography: everything that you write, including criticism and fiction, writes you as you write it. The real question is: this massive autobiographical writing-enterprise that fills a life, this enterprise of self-construction?does it yield only fictions? Or rather, among the fictions of the self, the versions of the self, that it yields, are there any that are truer than others? How do I know when I have the truth about myself? 434 We don?t see the world. We make it up. 435 The world is my idea. 436 The final orbit is oneself. Who can calculate the orbit of his own soul? 437 What personal essayists, as opposed to novelists or faux-naf memoirists, do: keep looking at their own lives from different angles, keep trying to find new metaphors for the self and the self?s soul mates. The only serious journey, to me, is deeper into the self. We?re all guaranteed, of course, never to fully know ourselves, which fails, somehow, to mitigate the urgency of the journey. To be alive is to travel ceaselessly between the real and the imaginary, and mongrel form is about as exact an emblem as I can conceive for the unsolvable mystery at the center of identity. Every documentary film, even?especially?the least self-referential, demonstrates in its every frame that an artist?s chief material is himself. 440 What does it mean to write about yourself? To what degree is this a solipsistic enterprise? To what degree are we all solipsists? To what degree can solipsism gain access to the world? 441 Speaking about oneself is not necessarily offensive. A modest, truthful man speaks better about himself than about anything else, and on that subject his speech is likely to be most profitable to his hearers. If he be without taint of boastfulness, of self-sufficiency, of hungry vanity, the world will not press the charge home. It is this egotism, this perpetual reference to self, in which the charm of the essayist resides. If a man is worth knowing at all, he is worth knowing well. 442 Mad genius? Narcissistic artist? An entertainer who can?t resist throwing in the kitchen sink? Viewers will make up their own definition for Ned?ad Begovicz, the director and central character of the aptly titled Totally Personal , which has much to say about what it?s like to like in Sarajevo, as seen through the quizzical eyes of his narrator-protagonist. Starting with his birth in 1958, Begovicz fills us in on what it was like to have the first TV on the block, to take loyalty oaths to Yugoslavian leader Tito and the Motherland, to get married to Amina, and to decide to make a no-budget film with a digital camera. All this and much, much more is narrated with self-deprecating humor in wonderfully accented English. The filmmaker?s precarious means, far from being a handicap to his storytelling, seems to inspire him to ever greater heights of imagination. He introduces whimsical theories about body parts and why the Serbian Chetniks started a war in Bosnia and what the U.N. forces were really doing during said war (answer: counting the number of shells fired). The film?s financial and technical limitations finally converge with the serious shortages that Bosnians experienced during the war?including no water, bread, electricity, or gasoline. Bosnians? innate creativity, Begovicz seems to say, has seen them through under all circumstances, just as his own imagination has created what he modestly calls his own little masterpiece. Totally Personal . Ned?ad Begovicz. Bosnia and Herzegovina . 2004. 79 minutes. Color and B&W. In Bosnian with English subtitles. World premiere. 443 There is properly no history, only biography. 444 All that is personal soon rots; it must be packed in ice or salt. 445 I place a living cat into a steel chamber, along with a device containing a vial of hydrocyanic acid. In the chamber is a very small amount of a radioactive substance. If even a single atom of the substance decays during the test period, a relay mechanism will trip a hammer, which will break the vial and kill the cat. I can?t know whether an atom of the substance has decayed, and consequently, can?t know whether the vial has been broken, the hydrocyanic acid released, and the cat killed. Since I can?t know, the cat is both dead and alive according to quantum law, in a superposition of states. Only when I break open the box and learn the condition of the cat is this superposition lost and the cat dead or alive. The observation or measurement itself affects the outcome; it can never be known what the outcome would have been were it not observed. . . . The writers I love tend to have Schrdinger?s Paradox tattooed on their forehead: the perceiver by his very presence changes what?s perceived. A work without some element of self-reflexivity feels to me falsely monumental. 446 The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography. 447 In On Moral Fiction , John Gardner explains that ?the morality of art is far less a matter of doctrine than of process.? He?s careful to distinguish between didactic art, which teaches by ?authority and force,? and moral art, which ?explores, open-mindedly, to learn what it should teach. The artist who begins with a doctrine to promulgate, instead of a rabble multitude of ideas and emotions, is beaten before he starts.? He cautions that ?the subversion of art to the purposes of propaganda leads inevitably to one or the other of the two common mistakes in bad art: overemphasis of texture on the one hand, and manipulative structure on the other.? In Vlemk the Box-Painter , Gardner ?s first novel following his critical call-to-arms, he doesn?t overemphasize texture?the fable-like quality of the book makes for a very simple prose?but he does manipulate structure. Vlemk the Box Painter is an illustration of a thesis, a step-by-step argument for the aesthetic program presented in On Moral Fiction . Gardner clearly conceived Vlemk as the dramatization of a doctrine. He didn?t discover his material in the process of creation; he began with a theory. Vlemk is a didactic rather than moral work of art, and Gardner ?s aesthetic would appear to be suspect if it can?t accommodate his own fiction. . . . This was the first thing I ever published. Its line of argument still seems to me essentially correct?John Gardner?s philosophy of fiction is impossibly programmatic?but that seems pretty obvious, and all I care about now is its secret subtext: on the surface a quite standard book review, it?s really my attempt to put as much ground as I could between myself and my parents? engag moralism. Growing up in a Bay Area suburb in the 1960s and ?70s, I was instructed by my mother and father to write denunciatory editorials about the (only very mildly) dictatorial high school principal; I was dragged into the city for antiwar marches what seems in memory every third weekend. In Against Interpretation , Susan Sontag says that the two primary, opposing artistic stances of the twentieth century are?were?Jewish moralism and homosexual aestheticism. I see my first published piece as a desperate effort to free myself from Jewish moralism; the effort shows. In college, my (Jewish) creative writing teacher?David Milch, who went on to co-write the television shows Hill Street Blues , NYPD Blue , and Deadwood ?told me my work suffered from the malaise of my (his) ?race?: a preoccupation with ?narrowly moral? rather than ?universally human? concerns. I was, as he hoped I?d be, near-suicidal for the remainder of the term. 448 For Coetzee, all criticism, including his own, is autobiographical. 449 Writing enters into us when it gives us information about ourselves we?re in need of at the time we?re reading. 450 Every man?s work?whether it be literature or music or pictures or architecture or anything else?is always a portrait of himself.
OP	11/08/2012 Driving and talking on the phone okay for police, but not the public There are two sets of rules -- one for drivers and another that allows police to do things for which they'd bust the rest of us. I was driving west on Upper Gerrard St. about 1.30 p.m. Thursday when I pulled up behind a Toronto Police cruiser stopped at a traffic signal at Victoria Park Ave. The light turned green and away we went, with me behind the cruiser. I soon noticed it was weaving a bit and going faster than traffic in the lane beside it. I stopped again behind the cruiser at Gerrard and Main, but this time, I was wondering about the erratic driving, so I looked hard at the exterior mirror attached to the door on the driver's side. I could see in the mirror that the cop's left hand was holding something up to his ear, and his mouth was moving. There was no one else in the car with him. It was clear that he was talking on his cell phone. For the record, it was cruiser 5103, with Ontario license plate AYES 033. We continued along towards Woodbine Ave., with me in the curb lane behind the cruiser, which hit speeds well above the 40 k/ph limit and continued to wander across the line between the curb and inner lanes. He got into the left-turn to go south on Woodbine - the same direction I was going -- and continued to hyold the phone to his ear through the turn and all the way down to Queen St., speeding up and slowing down for no apparent reason. The officer finally ended the call south of Queen, where Woodbine curves to the west and become Lake Shore Blvd. I could see that he was no longer holding the phone to his ear. But he was on it again as soon as we got past Coxwell, which had me thinking he started dialing someone else as soon as he was done the first call. We parted company at the on-ramp to the westbound Gardiner, where he veered right and stayed on Lake Shore, talking all the time and steering with one hand. I'm no cop, but if I was, and the car in front of me was not a cruiser, I would have pulled the driver over and written him a ticket for distracted driving, which carries a fine that can range from $155 to $500. I was tempted to try to get alongside of him and wag my finger, but I would have had to go at least 80 k/ph on the Lake Shore. I figured I'd be busted by an officer fishing for speeders with a radar gun. It's happened to me before. Which is why it is so annoying to watch a cop flagrantly ignore the rules he is sworn to enforce. I know what he'd do if it was the other way around. . Posted by The Fixer at 10:58:01 PM Comments You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the comment feed for this post. Police are also trained to use a computer, radio, emergency light and siren kit while patrol driving. They are trained to multitask while drive, unlike the general public. This clearly would make sense to extend to a cellphone, no? I don't think so. This guy was speeding and all over the road. He was distracted, not paying attention and a hazard to the traffic around him. I'm pretty good at multi-tasking, but it wouldn't be much of an excuse to a cop, even if I was trained to do it. Yes, by law, police officers are exempt from this law, but it doesn't make it any less dangerous. Before this law was created, driving and talking on the phone was legal. However, it was just as dangerous before the law was created as it was after. It's clear from the description of the events that a police officer is no better at driving and talking as a regular driver. It is also clear that SOME police officers don't see a problem with this and risk the lives of other drivers: http://forums.blueline.ca/viewtopic.php?\\... The first line of your article is 100% correct. It may annoy you, but there is nothing wrong with a police officer using a cellphone or radio while driving, since operators of emergency vehicles (police, fire and ambulance) are exempted from this rule. As for "speeding and all over the road", he may have been en route to a call, they don't always go lights and siren when they need to get somewhere quickly. Lights and sirens don't always help you get through traffic, since so many people don't react as they should when those lights are behind them. (Name and email address are required.

NA	Alex Zanardi just can't get racing out of his system. Despite losing both of his legs in a CART crash back in 2001, Zanardi has stayed competitive in auto racing ( as well as Paralympics cycling ), and according to Auto123.com , the Italian racer is now looking to join BMW in the DTM racing series. BMW has confirmed that Zanardi is interested in the series, but it was vague as to the possibilities of him joining the team. The report says that nothing is likely to happen for this season, and even after that, there is plenty of variables that will play into whether this becomes a reality... especially safety. This wouldn't be Zanardi's first stint behind the wheel of a BMW racecar as he won four races between 2004 and 2009 for the automaker in the World Touring Car Championship ( WTCC ) using a car with hand-controlled brakes and throttle. Add a Comment 9 Comments Zanardi isn't just a "paralympic champion". Change the title to "the rockstar who jumped the corkscrew, and did burnouts on victory lane should get a DTM ride". No need to coddle the guy, just because his legs are missing. Can a able bodied person drive a car with hand controlled brakes & accelerator and still call it fair. Given now that their feet are free, they could use it to adjust the tons of knobs that the driver usually has to do, or for regular drivers, they are able to change radio stations and text with their toes on full sized typewriters w/o taking their hands off the steering wheel.

He should come back to the us and race ALMS or Grand AM. Maybe run the Indy 500. Also someone needs to start a all motorsports racing network. But with non of the extra shows. JUST racing from allover the world. That would be the only station I would need. When Speedvision started that was my main go to channel. Jimmy Vasser is apparently trying to put together a deal for him to run Indy, but a sticking point is the fact that he'd be hampered getting out of the car in case of an emergency (like a fire). Also Speed started something called Speed2 (http://www.speed2.com) to show different racing series.
SP	Speech I was elected by the Australian people as Prime Minister of this country to bring back a fair go for all Australians and I have given my absolute best to do that, I've given it my absolute all. In that spirit I am proud of the achievements that we have delivered to make this country fairer. I'm proud of the fact that we kept Australia out of the global economic recession. I'm proud of the fact that had we not done so we would have had a half a million Australians out there out of work, because that's what happened around the rest of the world. I'm proud of the fact that we got rid of Workchoices and restored decency to the workplace. I'm proud of the fact that we started to build the nation's infrastructure including a National Broadband Network which I fundamentally believe will transform this economy in ways which we have yet to conceive, fundamentally transform our businesses and the way in which Governments operate, health services are delivered and the way in which education is delivered in our classrooms. The missing piece of 21 st century kit for our country. I'm proud of the fact that we have begun the education revolution. 300,000 extra computers in classrooms; that's a pretty big thing for a kid in a classroom who has never seen a computer on their desk before. I'm proud of the fact that we now have Trades Training Centres built to service every one of our nation's secondary schools. I'm proud of the fact that new libraries are springing up right across the country, often in schools which have never had a library before in their lives, or in some places, have never had a new building built in their schools since the War. I'm proud of the fact that we now have nationwide early childhood education. I'm proud of the fact that we now have a national curriculum for our schools, for every State of our nation and the Territories. I'm proud of the fact that we now have 50,000 more university places and the fact that we have invested so much more in our universities, in our research. I'm really proud of the fact that we've reformed the health system; a National Health and Hospitals network. When we look back on this in a decade's time, and the fact that we've made the Australian Government, for the first time in our history, the dominant funder of our nation's public hospital system. This will be seen as a very, very deep reform. I'm proud of the fact that we are building 20 regional cancer centres right across our country. You know if you go out there and people are suffering from cancer, it does alter your priorities. Many of those folk have never had decent cancers services before, never, and I was always stunned by the fact that people out there are three times more likely to die in the first years of their diagnosis through the lack of services. We've done something to change that, and it's big. It's the biggest investment in cancer services our nation has ever seen. I'm proud of the fact, and some people have probably never heard of this one, that we have a National Organ Transplant Authority. As somebody who borrowed someone else's aortic valve I feel a particular responsibility for that. There's nothing like having a bit of somebody else in you, it focuses the mind and in my case also focuses the heart. What I'm really pleased about in the last two months is the organ donation rates for the first time have started to rise. People now are getting transplants because we chose to make a difference. That's the funny thing about health isn't it, has an effect on you. I'm proud of the fact that we've restored decency to the aged pension, it's pretty important, making sure that people on the aged pension have some capacity for human dignity. An extra $100 is the biggest increase in the pension's history. I'm proud of the fact that we now have paid parental leave, it's been a long time coming. I'm proud of what we've done on homelessness. I'm proud of the fact that we're on track to halve homelessness in this country through work like common ground in which Therese is directly involved. I'm proud of the fact that we're adding 20,000 additional units of social housing. I can't stand it when you go to places and there is literally no place at the inn. I'm proud of the fact that the first thing we did in Government was ratify the Kyoto protocol. I'm also proud of the fact that we boosted the renewable energy target to 20 per cent. I'm proud of the fact that we tried three times to get an emissions trading scheme through this parliament, although we failed. And, if I had one point of future policy it must be our ambition to pass a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme within this parliament, the one that follows, I mean, so that we can make a difference, a real difference, to climate change. I'm proud of the fact that we now have, for the first time in the country's history, a Murray-Darling Basin Authority, and for the first time in our history a basin-wide plan and a basin-wide cap on water. Also proud of the fact that on the global stage Australia is now at the table of the G20. This is big for the country. When we look back on that in 10 years' time, having a place at the table when stuff goes wrong around the world is pretty useful. We lobbied hard and long for that. It is a good achievement for Australia for the future. I'm proud of the fact that we are closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Little things and big things: putting hundreds of Indigenous kids with scholarships into our nation's leading boarding schools; backing such things as the Clontarf Academy, now 22 of them we fund around the nation, to get kids to school and boost their attendance by providing AFL training. I'm proud of the fact that we're behind a commitment to create 50,000 additional jobs for Indigenous Australians with the private sector, and I'm most proud of the fact that about here, we greeted the stolen generations. As Therese reminded me, that was a big day. What I remember most about it, for those of you who weren't here, was as the stolen generations came in from over there, they were frightened. Our job was to make them welcome. The Apology was unfinished business for our nation. It is the beginning of new business for our nation. What I'm less proud of is the fact that I have now blubbered. I hope I've been able to demonstrate to you that this has been a very busy two and a half years. We have thrown our absolute all at this and I believe when we look back at this these reforms will endure into the future and make Australia, I believe, a fairer and better place than it would otherwise have been. And all that's before I get to the thank yous. First and foremost, I thank the Australian people for putting their trust in me. It is a high honour to be elected as Prime Minister of Australia and to the people of Australia I say thank you. To the members of the Australian Labor Party who put their trust in me, I say thank you. This is a Party and a movement of which I've been a member for the last quarter of a century, and I believe for the next quarter of a century. I thank the members of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, good women and men, each one of them - each one of them - committed to bringing about a fairer and better Australia in a cause which now goes back 120 years. I'd like to thank the members of the ministry and the cabinet. I could not have had a better team. These are head and shoulders above those who oppose them in the parliament - each and every one of them. You could go through the list. I've been blessed and aided by the fact that they have given every ounce of their intelligence and every ounce of their energy, every ounce of their ability, to delivering the reforms, and many others besides that I've just referred to. I thank the good people of Griffith in Brisbane, my electorate, for putting up with me as their local member - recently, somewhat missing in action. They are good people. It is a great community. I love it and I love them dearly. I thank my staff. They come in for the occasional mention in despatches. Alister Jordan, my Chief of Staff, an extraordinary young man. 31 years old, with the bearing of a 70 year old, part of the product of having worked for me for so long. A first class human being and a good man. I will not list the other members of my staff. That's probably for a private occasion. But given that you good members of the fourth estate are here, I should mention Lachlan Harris, and Fiona Sugden, and Maggie. They engaged with you on a daily basis, at times when it's good fun, and at times when it's less so. I think they're a fantastic team. My policy team, I won't go through. Each and every member of my staff have given their absolute best to the cause of this Australian Government. To my electorate staff in Brisbane, Gina Tilley and her team. Imagine being a Prime Minister with a seat Brisbane, with everyone rolling into your electorate office, holding them personally accountable for everything I have done here. Let's bear a thought for them. They are wonderful people. I thank my family, Therese, that's Jess, that's Nick, and the curly headed one with the good looks after his mother is Marcus. They are wonderful human beings. And, of course, my wider family as well. It is probably not the occasion for high statements of theology, but I'm sure you'd be disappointed if I didn't add something, given it's been the subject of comment over the years in which I've led this party. But to the great God and creator of us all, I thank him- or her- as well. Now, for the future. I will be dedicating my every effort to ensure the re-election of this Australian Labor Government. It is a good Government with a good program, and it deserves re-election for all the reasons I have listed before, and many more besides. And they are a good team, led by a good Prime Minister. I mean Julia, not me, because I'm still the Prime Minister, I think, for another quarter of an hour, so watch out because we can do things. Have you ever thought about this? I'm now not the leader of the Labor Party but I'm the Prime Minister. Anything could happen folks. As for serving the Government in the future, I will of course serve it in any manner in which I can be of assistance. I will be re-contesting the next election in the seat of Griffith. And I hope the good burghers of Griffith are understanding of my absence in recent times. Having said all of those things, what have I missed out? Therese? She's always more succinct than me. And much better looking. The work Therese has done in the community is formidable. And whether it's disabilities, homelessness, UNICEF. This is a very good person. A very, very good person and one of life's eternal mysteries is why she ever married me in the first place. She is a very good person, as are these fantastic kids of mine.
OP	Fanthropology Presented By Hyundai Fanthropology: Tell Your Story, Win A Trip Horned Frog fans, we have an opportunity for you to win an amazing trip... All you have to do is tell your story of why you are a crazy, amazing, fanatical fan. Do that, and you could be headed off to see TCU in the ________ Bowl! Hyundai is pretty cool people... You know how I know that? Because they think your fandom and devotion to the Horned Frogs is worthy of recognition, and they have come up with a pretty good way of rewarding it: An all expenses paid trip to any game this year, including the national championship game. Too good to be true? No, really, this is real. Here is what you get: - Two Round Trip Airline Tickets - Hotel Accommodations - Two Game Tickets Now, there is a qualification: You must be a crazy, lifelong, rabid fan of the Horned Frogs to be considered. Now, luckily, that is all of us! So here is what you need to do to be entered into the contest: - Post your story in the comments of this post, describing why you are a devoted fan of TCU and any/all relevant stories and facts that detail why you are the best fan ever. - We at FOW will select our favorite and contact you to build out your story further in a Q/A. This Q/A will be posted on FOW next week and entered to SBNation as our formal submission. If your fandom is the best, you win. Simple as that. The story of my fandom starts with my sister (roughly five years older than me) when she headed off to school... TCU, to be exact. I admittedly had only known three colleges in my youth, my hometown Longhorns and my mothers favorite Hoosiers and Wolverines. But, since I had three teams, no single one ever took over as the primary, until TCU. From day one, I was enamored with the Horned Frogs... Supporting the underdogs (as we always were back then) was fun, but having a personal connection to the team made everything that much more natural. So, when I finally had to make my decision on a college, TCU was a natural fit and away I went. In my time at TCU, I spent two years working in TCU Athletics (as an intern), helping with just about every on campus sport along the way. But, one sport always stuck out more than others for me: Baseball. Baseball had always been my favorite sport, more so than football or basketball, and I had been a crazy Texas Rangers fan since birth. But, TCU Baseball was my new love, with the connections that come with college sports attracting me in the same way they do you. The story gets long at this point: I, the optimistic salesman, started shaking hands and meeting folks in the industry. I used to have a Texas Rangers podcast at the time which had my name out there already, my presence at TCU Baseball game only helped to further these relationships. Over the last five years, I have been extremely blessed to develop contacts that have made this fandom turn into something more, something deeper and more involved than I ever dreamt possible. I love TCU Football, Basketball, Volleyball, Debate Club, all of the above... But, TCU Baseball is my passion, TCU Baseball in many ways is my job. One day, I will move on with life and TCU Baseball will be left behind, but I will never lose the friendships I have, the love of the game... Most of all, the history I have (in a small, small way) been a part of.
NA	More... 'It produces obvious conflicts of interest. You cannot ever have the patient in front of you think that it's in your interests not to treat them. 'It's not just me that thinks this -- I've yet to find someone who thinks it's a good idea. I don't sense overall enthusiasm. 'I'm very concerned that these schemes are happening.' Fears: Dr Laurence Buckman, chairman of the GP committee at the British Medical Association, said it is not acceptable to pay doctors for withdrawing treatment Under a scheme proposed by Harrow Primary Care Trust, in North West London, doctors have been promised up to 4 for every patient in their practice if they follow certain steps aimed at cutting referrals. The amount of money each practice gets depends on the number of patients on its books and whether it meets  all of the 'referral' targets that are set by the PCT. To get the full amount, practices must follow a number of steps, which include reducing their referrals by up to 10 per cent. They must draw up lists giving details of the name of the patient referred, the reason they were sent to hospital and the GP who ordered it. The practice must also nominate a GP to scrutinise every patient referral to hospital, to ensure they are 'appropriate'. The scheme covers all referrals, ranging from patients sent for scans to rule out possible cancer to those needing to see a specialist for a hip or knee replacement. If a practice meets all the criteria it will get 4 for every patient on its books. If it only fulfils some, it may get just 1 or 2 per patient. An average-sized practice with 6,500 patients stands to earn a maximum of 26,000 extra, provided it meets all the targets. Doctors could then decide to spend the money as they wished, on better facilities for the surgery or to increase their salaries, for example. The number of referrals varies hugely between practices depending on whether the local NHS trust has policies to try to limit them, patients' average age, and their illnesses. But a surgery with 6,500 patients is likely to send between 650 and 1,300 to hospital a year. A spokesman for Harrow PCT said the proposals were still 'under discussion' and had not yet been implemented. The PCT also insisted the scheme was meant to be in patients' 'best interests' and that they were trying to improve care while making the best use of NHS money. Other trusts and clinical commissioning groups -- organisations of GPs, which will in future be responsible for designing local health services -- are also offering money to practices that cut referrals, although the rewards are not as high. Changes: GPs have been promised financial incentives of up to 26,000 for their surgery if they take certain measures to reduce referrals. This picture is posed by a model At Hardwick Clinical Commissioning Group, in Derbyshire, practices are offered 25p per patient, up to around 1,600 in total, if they cut referrals. Luton PCT, in Bedfordshire, is also proposing to offer practices extra funding to cut referrals, though the details are still being drawn up. A spokesman for Harrow PCT said: 'This proposed scheme is about improving the clinical quality of referrals in the patient's best interest. 'The scheme is explicit in stating that patients must be referred where clinically appropriate at all times and that the process will ensure the best and most rapid treatment for that patient.' Although the NHS has been protected from cuts to its budget, it has been ordered to make 20billion of savings by 2014 by running more efficiently. Whitehall officials say the savings are necessary to ensure there is enough money to care for the increasing elderly population. But in the face of such stringent targets, many NHS trusts have resorted to trying to slash referrals, rationing certain treatments and cutting back on the number of staff. Some trusts are trying to reduce spending by sending patients to other surgeries or clinics which offer scans or specialist services such as physiotherapy, rather than sending them to hospital, because it is cheaper. Comments ( 73 ) Who said - we have 5 days to save the NHS - surely not TB? I thought it was patient's right to seek a second opinion AND of course we can still go to any Country in the EU and get all costs refunded from the NHS can't we? If true, it just goes to show how corrupt the whole NHS system has become. - Marcus_RM , London, United Kingdom, 15/9/2012 06:56&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt\\... yet there are still those who deny that the NHS is due for reform. This is something you don't have to put up with in Oz . Most X-rays , MRIs , CTs are done by private companies , and the longest wait is usually at the most a couple of days . If you stopped treating the World , you might be able to offer your own citizens a better service . Makes one think! maybe this is the reason so many patients are misdiagnosed. I now go private as most of the surgeries I enrolled with were absolutely useless, receptionists who thought they were doctors, triage nurses who misdiagnosed at every turn and then you finally get an appointment to see a GP or should I say the Locum who knows nothing about you apart from the last remark your actual GP made on the PC. Then if you are really lucky da dah you get to see your GP in between his golf and fishing whom if you are really on a lucky streak will inform you that he will only treat one ailment within your 5 minutes of allocated time, any other problems, make another appointment. Money for old rope if you ask me, hate going private as I used to believe strongly in the NHS, but at least I get the right treatment now and it saved my life, I find this so sad! After my husband had heart surgery, his consultant wrote to our GP in August 2011 asking him to arrange chest xrays & blood tests in 6 months time. When we approached our GP after 6 months he didn't feel it was necessary, so when we went back to the consultant after a year he hit the roof. Apparently the medication he is on could cause irreversible damage to his lungs & liver. Now we know why our GP didn't want to order the tests - money. We are all just income streams now to GPs, there to be milked for every last penny! It's took me nigh on a year, 14 weeks off work on the sick authorised by the doctor and a heck of a lot of pain to actually get a date for an MRI scan! I was in the surgery in tears of pain for the around the fifth time before it was finally suggested. I can SO believe this story.
ID	Resolved Question 4 and a half stone in 4 months,is it possible.? ,i am about 14 and a half stones right now,i would love to be around 12,or even 11 in two months but i know the body dosent work that way,if you have dieted with success please help! any tips hints/diet plans? Best Answer - Chosen by Voters That is about 63 pounds... that is not possible with a good diet and exercise... It is healthy to lose about a pound a week... so about One stone every 14 weeks is healthy. So in about 4 months a healthy weight to lose is 1 Stone. You have to get the quick fix mentality out of your mind and just decide to live a healthy life. You have to make yourself determined and take it one step at a time. Besides, anything worth having doesn't come easy. Seriously. Just take your time and don't stress out your body. Start with simple diet changes. Don't overhaul your diet at once, it is going to be either hard to continue with, or you're going to cheat and be miserable. Start exercising. Any exercise is better than none at all. Do strength training, and a little cardio, but focus on strength. This will give you better results. A simple google search on resistance training can go a long way. Things like, Push ups, squats, lunges, dips, pull ups etc. Take your time and progress. This, along with proper nutrition and consistency will get you results over time. Better to take it slow and a year from now you're healthy and glowing, rather than to try a quick fix, fail, and next year, be in the same position you were in before, back on yahoo answers asking people what to do... You know its the truth. and if you can't accept it you're never gonna lose weight and be healthier successfully. Source(s): check out marklauren.com for some healthy tips.

Other Answers (1) You shouldn't aim to lose more than 1-2lbs each week, so to lose 4.5 stone (63 lbs) you should aim for at least 32 weeks (about 7-8 months). If you try to lose too much too quickly your body will go into "starvation mode", meaning it will start to start to break down your muscle tissue for energy and store many of the few calories you do take in as an emergency reserve. Yes need to find out your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate), the amount of calories you use at rest, then create a calorie deficit, which means to take in less calories than you exert. For example, a person with a BMR of 2000 calories, If they were to eat 1500 a day and burn 500 of those with exercise(1500 - 500 = 1000) they would use1000 calories more than they took in each day (1000 - 2000 = -1000) a calorie deficit of 1000 per day would accumulate to 7000 per week There are 3500 calories to 1 lb of body fat, It is advisable to aim for a loss of 1 to 2 lbs per week. so to lose 1 to 2lbs per week you should aim to create a deficit of 500 to 1000 per day.
IN	Schulte's paper (going on DailyTech's account) places great emphasis on the fact that only one paper endorses 'catastrophic climate change'. This is a classic straw man argument. Oreskes' 2004 paper never refers to an imminent catastrophe. Neither do the IPCC nor do the Academies of Science from 11 countries that endorse the consensus position that most of the warming over the last 50 years is likely due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations. Even more fuss is made over the large percentage of neutral studies. Ironically, Oreskes emphasised the same point in 2004 when she published The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change . Nowadays, earth science papers are rarely found explicitly endorsing plate tectonics as the theory is established and taken for granted. The fact that so many studies on climate change don't bother to endorse the consensus position is significant because scientists have largely moved from what's causing global warming onto discussing details of the problem (eg - how fast, how soon, impacts, etc). What of the 6% of papers that reject AGW? The most appropriate approach would be to see what these papers actually say. Schulte's paper is yet to be published so the full list is not available (please contact me if you have more info). Monckton does mention several studies which one assumes are the "cream of the crop". Deltoid also has its readers categorising peer review studies since 2003 . The papers purported to reject the consensus can be divided into several categories: Non-scientific papers Two of the papers conduct no actual scientific research but merely review social aspects of climate science. I'm baffled as to why they would be included other than to "boost the numbers": Leiserowitz 2005 asks the question "Is Climate Change Dangerous?" It then proceeds to "describes results from a national study that examined the risk perceptions and connotative meanings of global warming in the American mind". In other words, it doesn't answer the question "is climate change dangerous" - instead it answers "does the public think climate change is dangerous?" Gerhard 2004 (published in the American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin) "summarizes recent scientific progress in climate science and arguments about human influence on climate". Papers that don't actually reject the consensus Cao 2005 recommends multi-scale modelling techniques to better understand and quantify the carbon cycle. It mentions uncertainties in our understanding of the carbon cycle but doesn't refute the consensus position at all. Lai 2004 suggests internal processes in the ocean may be causing global warming. Paradoxically, it concludes by recommending we "reduce carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, thus reduce global warming". More on the ocean... Moser 2005 studies the uncertainties of the impact of rising sea levels in 3 US states. The emphasis is on society's ability to adapt to rising sea levels and contributes no research on the cause of global warming. Bonafide scientific papers rejecting the consensus There are some papers that conduct original research and reject the consensus. It's useful to look at the actual arguments they present to reject AGW: Zhen-Shan 2006 , performs statistical analysis on the temperature record and finds temperature doesn't linearly follow CO2. Looking at global cooling from 1940 to 1970, they conclude "The global climate warming is not solely affected by the CO2 greenhouse effect". Ignoring aerosol cooling and solar forcing while failing to recognise that temperature's relationship with CO2 is logarithmic, not linear, are serious failings. More on mid-century global cooling...
NA	As per a recent survey, 25% people take antibiotics to prevent cold from deteriorating and sometimes to recover early from it. However, doctors have totally disapproved the idea and said that taking antibiotics for colds and simple flu is just a misuse of the medicines. Number of people has though fallen since 2009 but still one-third of the people use antibiotics in colds. Doctors' meeting was organized by the Health Service Executive (HSE) where the doctors came up with their views and experiences regarding the antibiotics use. Dr. Fidelma Fitzpatrick, a consultant microbiologist said that antibiotics have transformed lives by saving from infections. However, as we are taking them for granted, we are nearing pre-antibiotic era again, she added. Highlighting the adversities of misuse and overuse of antibiotics, she cleared that it has caused the bacteria to find out ways for protecting themselves. Subsequently, we are seeing tremendous rise in superbugs across the world. The following guidelines were, thus, issued to make people aware about their use: Antibiotics don't cure or prevent colds and flu so there's no point taking them in such illness. Take antibiotics as prescribed and for the right time. Don't indulge in self medication and always complete the antibiotic course even if you feel well.

SP NA	This past summer, the BCS Presidential Oversight Committee met in Washington, D.C., and approved massive and dramatic changes to the process of how college football will crown a national champion. As we know now, starting in 2014, there will be four-team playoff at the conclusion of each season. Virginia Tech president Charles Steger was the chair of the committee that also included USC president Max Nikias, Nebraska chancellor Harvey Pearlman, Texas president Bill Powers, Florida president Bernie Machen, and Notre Dame's Rev. John Jenkins, among others. Simply put, the biggest, most powerful men in college football were all in one room to make some major changes. I had the chance to visit with Dr. Steger in his office a few weeks ago to discuss a variety of issues, including the future of the ACC, finances at Virginia Tech and the experience of chairing the committee that changed how college football will crown its champion. ROTH: What was your professional and personal experience in chairing this committee? STEGER: "Well, it was an interesting experience because there were many people at the outset who felt that getting this group together, while we may result in a conclusion, it was going to take multiple days. But we did a lot of preparatory work, a lot of phone calls, and the commissioners ... I have to say the commissioners deserve tremendous credit in putting together a proposal that was viable for the presidents to look at. Now, you have a group of individuals all of whom reflect complex constituencies. Each one, each president, represents a conference, their alumni, the alumni of the conference, traditions like the Rose Bowl and things like that. So there's a complicated agenda, and getting them all on the same page took us several hours." ROTH: How do you get a group like that to a consensus? STEGER: "I think everybody felt that not making a decision that day was a very undesirable outcome. I think everybody also shared the same objective that we wanted to do what was best for college football, what was best for one's respective conference. And of course, each person had to look out for the best interests of his own institution. So we had to find a compromise point, and we ultimately did. But there was a lot of discussion. I think any question that the presidents were a 'rubber stamp,' or there was no institutional control, is quite false. These are very strong individuals, and I have to say that many of the presidents could have chaired the committee just as I did. It's just I ended up with the short straw." ROTH: You're modest, but let me ask you: this decision, while very important, would seemingly be far afield from the typical duties of most presidential executives. How engaged do you think the other presidents were, taking into consideration the great ramifications of this decision? STEGER: "I think all of us had to do a lot of homework, just understanding the levels of commitment it takes to have a successful and exciting intercollegiate football season. So you have to appreciate the work the bowl committees do in the various cities and the economic impact of that, which is quite significant. You have to understand what's happening in the television markets. And I think very importantly, you have to be sure that you look after the interests of the fans who come to the games. The ones who watch on TV are important, but the ones who fill up those stadiums, the ones who travel to the bowl games, their interests all have to be incorporated in this. So you're thinking about all these things at the same time, and then you're thinking 'Okay, now how am I going to get a majority from this group?' So it was a challenge, but it all worked out." ROTH: Why is four the right number? STEGER: "Four was not too far, but just far enough. When you go beyond that, you get a whole set of logistical issues. We thought this provided a balance of access and participation by the bowls, and it was a manageable configuration of games that we could run. Everybody came in there with the understanding that they were going to have to compromise something. And as a result, we all concluded that, as a first step, certainly this was a good idea. I think it's been pretty well received." ROTH: There's been a lot of speculation about the long-term sustainability and viability of the Atlantic Coast Conference. How committed to the ACC is Virginia Tech? And secondly, in your opinion, do the other schools, do the other presidents, share that commitment? STEGER: "First of all, there should be no question about Virginia Tech's commitment to the ACC. We are stalwart members, and we share a lot of values with the other schools, as well as the wonderful geographic footprint for our program because of the travel, particularly for the Olympic sports. People often forget that you have football and basketball, but we also have 19 other sports that participate in this league, and it's very important that we have the capacity for all of those students to participate. So we're committed. We think it's a great conference up and down the entire East Coast. It's a tremendous media market. And before the meeting in Washington, where we made the (BCS) decision, I had private conversations with every president in the ACC. There is no exception. Everyone is committed to staying. I know there has been speculation about Clemson and Florida State , but I can tell you that Jim Barker, who is the president of Clemson, and I go back decades. He probably doesn't want to admit this (laughing), but the same with Florida State. While there are people talking about it, I don't think there's any likelihood of any of those schools leaving the ACC." On September 12th, Notre Dame joined the ACC as a full member. Dr. Steger released the following statement: "I join my other ACC presidents in welcoming the University of Notre Dame to the conference. It is a great fit. In addition to its strong athletic reputation, Notre Dame is a highly respected university ranking among the nation's best. " ROTH: Some presidents are actively involved in their schools' athletics programs. Others are not. What is your opinion on how an institution's highest executive should be engaged in an athletics program? STEGER: "Well, one, you have a fiduciary responsibility to make sure the athletics enterprise is well-managed, and all the complexities that go along with it. Secondly, and this is certainly true from my point of view, you should recognize that the head coaches know much more about these teams and games than you do. Your job is to be sure you have the right personnel in place and let them do their job. I think Jim Weaver and his staff and Frank Beamer and all of our coaches are fine people, and we share a sense of values. We are very well managed financially. So my real touchstone is: "Are these programs run with integrity? Are we generating the revenues we need to make it all go? And do I have confidence in these individuals as people who are well-represented and known all around the country representing this institution?" On all counts at Virginia Tech, it's 'Yes.' So I try to be as supportive as I can, and I talk with Jim frequently. We share the values and objectives, and they try to be helpful to me, and I try to reciprocate when I can." ROTH: Athletics are such a big part of campus life at Virginia Tech for a growing student body. How is the university able to keep its fees so low, particularly when it comes to athletics, when compared to its ACC sister institutions and some schools in the state? STEGER: "We are very fortunate. We are one of a small number, I think it's 15 or 16 institutions in the country, that are in the black with their athletics programs. If you compare our student athletics fee, which is $268 per year, with the $1,400 or $1,800 per year of other schools in Virginia, it's really quite remarkable. We do that through a series of things. One, we have a very well managed enterprise. We have successful programs, and our financial people have been very skilled in placing bonds in the market to finance facilities at the right time. All of that coming together enables us to keep the overall cost of education down for our students. We are very proud of that." ROTH: While facilities in athletics continue to grow, when one walks across this campus, we see cranes in the air all over the place. Why is this happening now? STEGER: "Over time, Virginia Tech has grown in terms of the undergraduate and graduate population. We added about 2,500 undergraduate students a few years ago. We have tremendous demand for students who want to come here, and we also added about 2,000 graduate students who help with programs and help support the dramatic expansion of our research programs. Our research expenditures last year exceeded $450 million. They were about $168 million just seven or eight years ago. So we found ourselves with our programs growing faster than the facilities and laboratories that were available. "Secondly, we need to modernize them to be in tune with the new instructional technologies, and most importantly, we want to provide for our students in terms of recreational facilities the best we can. We're still not far enough ahead on that, even though we've built several million square feet of space. We still have a ways to go. "Now, how is that financed? The state provides, through bond issues, funding for projects, but over half of everything that's constructed on campus is funded by other sources. Principally that comes from research overhead dollars, and it comes from private donations. And, of course, there is no state money that goes to any athletics facility. We raise all of those dollars, and our alumni have been very generous in making that possible." ROTH: Back to football now. What is the game day experience like for you at Lane Stadium ? STEGER: "Well, it's always exhilarating, I have to say. On football weekends, I'll start out by speaking to some number of groups at breakfasts or board meetings. Sometimes, I walk through the tailgate parties, which are quite incredible enterprises (laughing). But more importantly, when you go there and see 66,000 people at the stadium, this kind of collective experience is exhilarating and inspiring. While everyone comes to see the game, it brings this community of people together. They have something that they share. It builds a sense of community, which undergirds the Hokie Nation. And when 'Enter Sandman' is played, you can't help but be excited -- and I enjoy it."

These chilies are long, green and somewhat large.  Because they are not very hot, they can be easily added to many different recipes. Anaheim peppers have thick skins which are difficult to cut, but if you put them on a hot burner and let them burn, the skin will peel off easily. These chilies are great as salsa base, as garnish, for soup ingredients and are frequently used in almost all Mexican dishes. Anaheim Varieties The Anaheim chili pepper can grow from 6-10 inches long.  Although they are of medium heat, their heat is dependent on where they are grown.  The New Mexico varieties are hotter than the Californian ones, and ripe red ones are hotter than the green ones. They have a savory taste and although usually used when green, they can be used when ripened to a red color.  The common variety will have a dark green, reddish color when ripe. However other varieties are full red, when ripe. The red varieties are used to make ristras after they are strung together in pods and dried. Anaheim Chilies Maturity: They reach maturity in 75-80 days. Uses: They are great when stuffed and cooked whole with rice and cheese-based cream. They taste great too. Storing: Line plastic bags with paper towels. Place Anaheim chilies in bag and then store in fridge.  They can be kept for weeks in the fridge. Preparing: Use a knife to cut off the top. Take out the seeds and the white pith with a sharp but small knife. Fill the peppers with the stuffing of your choice and put the top back on. Always wear gloves when preparing chilies for cooking. Cooking: Place your stuffed Anaheim chilies in an oven and bake at for 20-30 minutes at 180C for 20- 30 minutes or until tender. Buying Tips Your local grocery store will have ample supply of Anaheim peppers in the produce area.  Although they are used when ripe, Anaheim peppers are mostly used when they are green. When purchasing fresh Anaheim peppers, choose the ones that have deep colors and firm and unblemished skin. Canned chilies are also available in grocery stores. Anaheim in Recipes There are many ways in which the Anaheim can be used in different recipes. They are especially tasty when served stuffed. Seeds and pith must be removed before cooking Anaheim Chilies are mild, and are tasty when added to salsas, chili recipes, and dips. Remove seeds and pith. Stuff them with lots of cheese; soak in batter and then deep fry. Anaheim peppers can be roasted on an outdoor grill. Peppers should be turned for even cooking. However if cooking on an open flame check peppers frequently. Anaheim chilies can be stuffed with Mexican cheese. Roll stuffed chilies in beaten egg and flour and fry in pan until golden brown. Cook up a stew with potatoes, zucchini, ground beef, and Anaheim chilies. Anaheim can be used to make creamy chili pepper sauce to add flavor to meat and or cheese dishes.

IN	Creativity - Perception "The voyage of discovery lies in not finding new landscapes, but in having new eyes". Marcel Proust Two people can look at the same thing and see completely different result. How you perceive depends upon many different elements. When you look at the cube do you see it rising up with the bottom showing or dropping down with the top showing? In psychology and the cognitive sciences perception is defined as the process of acquiring, interpreting, selecting and organising sensory information. This is achieved through your senses, your state of mind, your mental model of the world, (are you guided by the spirits or is the government out to get you) beliefs and values. So is the glass half empty or half full? The answer of course is it depends on your perception. A perception can give rise to a multiple construct for example in the illustration is a tiger but do you see a proud beast, a savage man killer, an endangered specie, a good circus act, memories of Indian mogul painting or a cute cat. The other side to this is If you have no experience of something there is a strong likelihood that you will simply not perceive it and it will not exist. For example two people discussing a game of rugby would see things quite differently if one has never played and has only experienced watching their local schoolboy club whilst the other is a single ex all black. Perception is the way we look at things. Processing is what we do with that perception. The ability to consciously and creatively direct our attention and thinking towards our surroundings, people and events in a creative way encourages mental playfulness and choices in how to experience the world Perception is possibly the most important element in creative thinking before technical matters. So some ways of broadening and changing perception are needed to stimulate creativity. Perception is the way we look at things. Processing is what we do with that perception. The ability to consciously and creatively direct our attention and thinking towards our surroundings, people and events in a creative way encourages mental playfulness and choices in how to experience the world Perception is possibly the most important element in creative thinking except for technical matters. Information is organized in our brains into patterns and almost all errors of thinking are the result of flawed perception. In order to stimulate creativity so some ways of broadening perception and changing perception is needed. The purpose of perception is to allow patterns to form in the mind and then to use them. The mind is very good at recognising whole patterns, abstracting or identifying hidden patterns. Pattern formation relies upon the way we choose to look at something, by classifying things and identifying points of difference we make certain predictions and judgments. These predictions and judgments are the essential building blocks upon which ideas are formed, therefore the richer these building blocks the richer the potential of the ideas. We choose what to focus attention on interpreting or thinking about whatever is focused upon. There is far more happening in the environment than can be given attention at a given moment. Designers constantly select what they need to be aware of, the majority of the time this is done subconsciously and depends upon the demands on our attention. Take time to build awareness observe how the mind is working and notice what is being perceived and adopt some of these strategies: Briefly notice and classify the things that surround you Think of personally meaningful associations to those things Evaluate what you notice Formulate questions about items or events noticed Think about personal goals or tasks These forms of awareness are limitless and will shift with a mood, situation, goal or the influences upon the way we think and perceive. Invariably the form of awareness is not conscious, therefore developing perceptual awareness will break our perceptual ruts. The two basic perceptual modes involved in problem definition and solving; making the familiar strange and making the strange familiar. The natural tendency of a person when faced with a strange situation is to reduce it to categories, fitting it into an accepted pattern. This process is economic but leads to stereotyped thinking. Basic novelty demands a fresh viewpoint, a new way of looking at the problem. Most problems are not new. The challenge is to view the problem in a new way. The link between perception and the creative process is closely related to habituation and saturation. Over-familiarisation with an idea, method, or object is a trap. The irony is the more adept you are at something, the less likely you are to appreciate a variation in interpretation, then generate new approaches. Therefore consciously placing yourself in another's shoes or forming a team that includes others with differing skills will provide a greater degree of potential insight Perception lies at the root of all creativity, learning how to see is the start of creative thinking. Edward De Bono advises a process of restructuring perceptions in many different ways. This involves trying alternative initial approaches and avoiding repetitious solution patterns. Then re-conceptualising the problem and identifying new perspectives. Once a perspective is adopted only rarely are new lines of thought opened, by consciously thinking of a completely unrelated subject it is possible to break these trains of thought. "The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend." Henri Bergson Part of what we perceive comes through our senses to form the basis of how you perceive the world and your particular reality. Another part (and it may be the larger part) always comes out of our mind. The model illustrates this concept. Stimulus -- This can take many forms like light, sound, mechanical or chemical energy. Sensory Receptors -- the stimulus is processed by receptors and processed in the relevant part of the brain. Cognitive processing -- The brain links the signals turning the stimulus into a recognisable image, colour, sound, texture, or taste. This processing forms links with information stored in the brain as memories that are associated with the stimuli e.g. Shape -- mammal, colour -- tiger, sound -- roar, danger -- high etc. You are now in possession of the facts Perceptual Stimuli -- depends to a large extent on your knowledge, experience and imagination. This is very much an individual element as we all have varying beliefs, values, conditioning, biochemistry and emotive states in the here and now. The Perceptual Process We need to understand this because in order to become more perceptive we need to recognize which perceptual filters we view the world through. Creative seeing, uses the imagination to re-center different viewpoints. Re-centering is characterised by the flexible ability to change from one imaginative filter to another. The re-centered perceiver may see the illustration as a proud beast, a dangerous killer, an endangered species, cute and fluffy, a potential rug, a national symbol or a mythical figure. Most people can all see imaginatively, not all see creatively. The key concept is flexibility. The person, who can use his imagination flexibly to re-center his viewpoint, sees creatively. Challenge desire to change. Information correct and board. Flexibility easy access to subconscious as well as conscious levels of thinking. Proficient using a variety of mental operations and moving freely from one to another. The process of re-centering is fundamentally a process of unlearning. For most people breaking lazy, category hardened, fear-induced habits of seeing is an un-educational task of considerable magnitude. R. D Lang defines the depth of the problem. "Our capacity to see, hear, touch, taste and smell is so shrouded... that an intensive discipline of unlearning is necessary before one can begin to experience the world afresh, with innocence, truth and love". Clearly perceiving the problem or the information needed to solve the problem requires conscious awareness of perceptual barriers. Too often, we look at a problem expecting to see something, then respond to the first thing we think of. Common perceptual blocks are: Inability to identify the right problem, stereotyping, assumptions, inappropriate problem solving strategies. Patterns give us the power to understand the world and consequently, they rule our thinking and become the rules according to which we live our lives. The mind is very good at forming patterns; we recognise sequences, cycles, shapes, processes, similarities and probabilities. A common problem is becoming locked into one particular approach, method or strategy without acknowledging that other approaches may be more appropriate Creative thinking involves not only generating new ideas but escaping from obsolete ones as well. Periodically inspect your ideas and beliefs to see if they are habit bound and contributing to the effectiveness of your thinking. Firstly ask "Why did this concept, project, idea come to exist" Then "Do these reasons still exist"? Assumptions about the problem should be studied as they will affect the perception you have of the problem. Often a label is attached to an object or problem and it becomes difficult to see beyond that label. Inadequate clues or information also obscures problems, if the problem is not correctly identified it will not be properly solved. When stating or analysing a problem there is a tendency to delimit the problem area too closely by imposing too many constraints, not looking at the problem from various viewpoints or considering the interests of those affected. Exercises Visit an interesting site museum, gallery craft\gift shop etc. Look at the exhibits as you normally would. If you are with a friend Talk with your partner as to what you tend to see and how you think of the exhibits as you normally experience the exhibits (see mostly sculptures, colours, materials, age, feelings, ownership) Swap awareness plans so you see the exhibits from your partner's perspective and view more of the exhibition. Now pretend you are a team of famous artists whatever type you like you have worked together on internationally successful projects with great recognition. You have a commission to produce a magnificent public work of art with unlimited budget or location. You have only 30 minutes to create your concept. Use the objects around you to as sources of inspiration for planning your work of art (plan it out) Experience the world of the topsy-turvy. Stand with your back to whatever you want to look at bend over and look between your legs at the scene that you want to contemplate. Try having a conversation with someone in this position. Look at the world through a distorted surface like a polished metal bowl. Reverse habitual behaviors like eating dinner at breakfast, wearing your shoes on opposite feet. Imagine your room with the colours and surfaces all reversed. Reverse functions imagine wearing dishes, eat from your hat, sleep in a lily pad, fish fly, cars walk, reverse roles be another object, a different person an animal or insect. Colour grouping. Instead of grouping things as you would normally see them label them with different qualitative categories like colour, material, function. Instead of looking for furniture look for all things red 'rediture', look for 'squareiture' (all things angular), Look for 'smoothiture' 'softiture', 'plasticiture' etc. etc. Visual similarities. Viewing an object ask yourself "what does it recall" for example. describe a fire as a 'glittering bouquet'. Make sure that your simile makes a substantial imaginative leap a flower should not be another flower or even another plant but perhaps a dinner plate, a explosion of lace, living perfume. Imagine new uses for things that surround you. Find different uses for an object you would not normally consider. How can a pair of shoes be more functional, educational, could it be a toy, what sort? What about a musical instrument, a communication device, a hobby, what is the silliest idea or the most practical thing you can think of? View everyday objects as if they were art exhibits. Ask what is interesting or beautiful about this object, what does it communicate, feelings, moods, associations with life or society, why was it chosen, why is it valued, what can be learned from its aesthetics, balance, harmony, materials, form, surprise, expressiveness, what skills, energy was used. Noticing things you normally wouldn't. How would things look if you took on the opposite gender role, a gay man or a transvestite? Take the role of another profession or occupation, Deliberately provoke yourself to closely observe ordinary things, find common materials in an environment, colours, human and animal behavior, sensory stimulation, patterns, forms, ideas, processes. Imagining improvements in problem spots around you. What area or object bugs you how can you improve it so it looks, works, behaves the way you would like it to. How can it be improved for other people, tourists, disabled, children or dogs. How would you go about making these improvements what sort of expertise would be needed? Thinking of things you can learn from whatever you encounter. Open you mind to the learning opportunities around you. How can your encounters with objects, situations, places, people or ideas be used to teach you something that is of use for your job, hobby, family or friends, how could this stimulate a conversation, what would someone else in a different circumstance gain from it?
NA	Those who are familiar with the town will know there is no shortage of harbourside bars and restaurants in Fethiye where it's possible to while away a few hours watching the world go by. Over the years, we've probably frequented all of them at least once, be they established Fethiye institutions, such as Cafe Geni? , or the brand new places like Shaka Restaurant , further along down the kordon towards al?? . But, however long you live somewhere, there's always one of those cafes that gets overlooked; the sort that, each time you walk past it, the 'we-really-must-try-that-place-one-day' thought comes into your head. For a few years now, we've had that thought each time we walk past Deniz Kafe . The arched entrance to Deniz Kafe A couple of weeks ago, we decided to walk to Kuleli Koyu with friends and, as we were passing Deniz Kafe, they mentioned they'd recently had a coffee there and it was a lovely place to sit - a perfect cue for us to finally give it a try. We went through the archway and down the steps towards the sea shore. Jetty seating at Deniz Kafe True enough - it certainly is a lovely place to sit. We were suddenly hidden from the main road above us and surrounded by foliage and the marinas of Fethiye - and we were the only customers in there at the time. Even better. Deniz Kafe is not decked out with designer, super-stylish furniture - far from it - but that's not the type of place this is. It's homely and secluded. A little secret place by the sea. And you're not going to get the latest fashionable Italian coffee here, either. Like we said, Deniz Kafe is homely. We ordered a coffee, the kettle went on and the owner delivered four mugs of steaming, instant coffee, a tub of Coffeemate and a bowl of sugar cubes. Looking towards one of Fethiye's marinas from Deniz Kafe And that was fine by us. They were delivered with a smile, they were much larger than we expected - and that meant we could take our time with them and enjoy our peaceful surroundings. So now, our 'we-really-must-try-that-place-one-day' thoughts are no more and they've morphed into 'we-really-must-go-back-there-one-day' thoughts. No posh coffee, no slap-up meals (there's a small snack menu) and it doesn't matter. Oh, you can get an Efes Pilsen in there, of course. Always a bonus. Maybe we'll drop in next time we walk to Kuleli Koyu or hike to Kayaky ...or maybe we'll just make a special journey to go and sit there and not move for a few hours. It's that sort of place. Deniz Kafe is on the seashore at the end of 2 Karagzler, across the road from Ata Park Hotel . View it on our map of Fethiye here . This place makes me smile. :-) I LOVE that they served you instant coffee. That's just brilliant. :-) I've never had so much instant coffee in my life as I've been served here in Australia. And just hearing about it makes me feel, well, nostalgic somehow. :-)
HI	FOOD & DRINK; Olives show their true colours There may be a black-hearted charlatan among them, but there are still many succulent, tasty olives out there. Michael Bateman examines the options on offer, whether you prefer yours stuffed, cooked or unadulterated When is a black olive not a black olive? Answer: When it's a green olive. As they start picking the new season's green olives around the Mediterranean we should be well advised to consider this conundrum. It's not so much a riddle, as a fact of commercial life. There are people, you see, who want black olives but don't like the taste of them. All black olives started life as green olives, vigorous, tough-skinned fruit. Then they ripened and turned pinkish-brown, gradually mauvish-purple and, finally, a glossy, wrinkled black; by now slippery with the savoury oil we love. But many find a ripe black olive unpalatable. Thus, a design team would consign fat, wrinkled, old black olives with their slimy, decaying flesh to the bin. And, yuck, that taste, so strong, so bitter, earthy. Why can't a black olive be more like a green olive? The designer black olive would be as taut as a ripe cherry. Its taste would be unassertive. And, for the sake of convenience, it wouldn't have a stone to break your tooth on (pitting slippery, soft ripe black olives is one of life's less rewarding tasks). Hmmm, sounds like a candidate for genetic engineering. In fact the Designer Black Olive was achieved by Californian cosmetic scientists. And today, using their techniques, olive factories in Spain are churning out tins of them in their hundreds of thousands. I made my acquaintance with them one day when I was faced with a choice between an expensive jar of bottled olives, and this modestly priced, handsome-looking can, with the apparent bonus that the olives had been pitted. I opened the can and found with some surprise that they did not taste of olives. Amazing. I drained them, drenched them in good olive oil (what a waste), and served them on a plate without comment. And, without comment, they were tasted and ignored. Can you imagine a bowl of juicy purple Kalamata olives being left untouched? If you like the taste of black olives you wouldn't buy these, so why is there a market for them? Well, as a garnish. Even before the idea of the Mediterranean Diet, Americans sliced them onto millions of pizzas consumed every year. In salads too, night-black olives set off the green of salad leaves, the red of a slashed tomato. They don't have any taste, agrees expert Anne Dolomore, author of several books on olives and olive oil. But she doubts if it's a scam any more than many food industry practices. Yes, she says, it is a charlatan, a green olive which has been "dyed" black. How do they do that? Interesting. The green olive, as you will know if you've ever picked one off a tree, is supremely unpalatable. Yet its astringent, mouth-puckering bitterness can be drawn out by soaking it in water for weeks, or more effectively by leaving it in an alkaline solution of caustic soda. That's the basic method. But there's more to producing say a gourmet olive, such as those giant, succulent green Queen Olives from Seville. These olives are first treated with with alkali to remove bitterness, then soaked in a brine which will produce lactic-acid fermentation and their characteristic flavour and texture. Throughout, it's essential to exclude air, or else the olive will oxidise and turn an offensive brown. Left too long, they will go black. Go black? Green olives will turn black? So this is how they dye them. They plunge green olives into open tanks of caustic soda and agitate the mixture continuously for a week to 10 days, until they become a dark but not very lovely black. Then they wash the soda off and treat them with ferrous gluconate to fix the colour. Because of their firmness, they will stand up to machine-pitting and, finally, they are canned in brine. Black olives, of a sort. Forget about the flavour. Stuffed olives are a charming alternative, green olives pitted and filled with anchovy, red pepper, almonds or - a new variety - smoked salmon. Alas, some choices are not what they seem, for in switching from hand- filling to machine-stuffing, something has been lost. Examine the pimiento stuffing and you will find it is a piece of extruded paste, not a morsel of red pepper. The good news is the increasing range of olives offered in speciality shops and at deli counters; as it's possible to taste before buying, you can't go wrong. Many delis make up their own cracked green olives marinated in spiced and herbed mixtures, using anything from olive oil and lemon juice, lemon peel, cumin seed and coriander seed, to garlic and hot green peppers. There's no reason why you shouldn't buy bog-standard olives, green or black and do your own. Anne Dolomore suggests the following recipes: CRACKED GREEN OLIVES Rinse 1kg (2lb 4oz) of green olives and crack them with a hammer to break the flesh but not the stone. Put into a jar, layering with coriander seeds (6 tablespoons), dried oregano (4 tablespoons) and peeled garlic cloves (about three). When jar is full, top up with olive oil. Marinate for two to three weeks. MARINATED BLACK OLIVES Fill a deep jar with 500g (1lb 2oz) black olives, adding 30ml (2 tablespoons) red wine vinegar, two cloves of garlic, 15ml (1 teaspoon) paprika and one slice of lemon, topping up with olive oil. Leave to marinate for two or three weeks. GARLIC OLIVES Drain brine from a jar of green olives, reserving half the brine. Return to jar with two crushed cloves of garlic and a pinch of oregano. Mix the reserved brine with enough white wine vinegar and olive oil to top up the jar. Leave for several weeks to mature. Here are the instructions on how to make two traditional olive pastes - a tapenade from France, and a green olive paste from Spain - and also the recipes for two dishes that include olives, all are taken from Anne Dolomore's Essential Olive Oil Companion (Macmillan pounds 10.95). TAPENADE This Provencal spread is delicious on toasted bread and served as a canape, or it is often used to stuff hard-boiled eggs. Some recipes contain tuna but I think that just the flavour of the olives and anchovies is best. 200g/8oz black olives, stoned 2 cloves garlic 200g/8oz capers, drained 100g/4oz anchovy fillets 5ml/1 teaspoon mustard 15ml/1 tablespoon olive oil If you think the anchovies are going to be too salty, soak them in milk for 10 minutes. Then place all the ingredients in a blender and mix to a smooth paste. GREEN OLIVE PASTE This paste is a mixture of typical Spanish produce which can be used as a spread on bread to serve as tasty tapas. It makes an ideal snack to hand round to your guests when you are having a barbecue. Serves up to 12, as nibbles 40 green olives, stoned 5ml/1 teaspoon capers 4 anchovies 5ml/1 teaspoon ground almonds 1 clove of garlic 60ml/4 tablespoons olive oil 12 teaspoon cumin 12 teaspoon paprika 14 inch slices of french bread imiento for garnish Place all the ingredients, except the bread and pimiento, into a food processor and mix until you have a fine paste. Spread thinly on the slices of bread, decorate with pimiento pieces. PASTA WITH BLACK OLIVES Serves 4 500g/1lb penne or rigatoni 200ml/7fl oz olive oil 400g/14oz tin of tomatoes 2 cloves of garlic, crushed 300g/12oz tin tuna in oil, drained 1 tin anchovy fillets in oil, drained and chopped 12 black olives salt and black pepper, to taste Cook the pasta in plenty of salted, boiling water with a dash of olive oil. When it is al dente drain and tip into a serving bowl. While still hot pour over the olive oil and toss well. Put the tomatoes with their juice and the garlic into a blender and process until you have a thick sauce, then stir this into the pasta, adding salt and black pepper. Add the flaked tuna and anchovies, then stir in the olives. Serve warm, or cold, but do not refrigerate. OLIVE ROMANY The Spanish omelette is famous the world over. In this recipe, a small, plain omelette is combined with olives to make an unusual stuffing for beef. This is an old family recipe from Maria Jose Sevilla, the Spanish cookery writer. 3 eggs 600g/1lb 4oz skirt of beef 100g/4oz green olives, stoned 23ml/112 tablespoons flour 60ml/4 tablespoons olive oil 2.5ml/12 teaspoon thyme 120ml/4fl oz dry white wine 240ml/8fl oz beef stock salt and pepper, to taste Using the eggs, make three plain omelettes. Lay the skirt of beef flat and, using a sharp knife, cut a layer across the meat to within 2cm of the opposite side. Roll back the top layer and season. Place the omelettes and olives on top of the meat, covering the whole surface. Roll up the meat, secure with string and dust it with flour. Heat the olive oil and brown the meat. Add the thyme and wine and cook for a few minutes. Reduce the heat, add the stock and simmer for about an hour or until the meat is tender, adding more stock if necessary. Place on a large serving dish and remove the string. Allow the meat to rest for a few minutes, then slice. Pour the juices from the pan over the beef. Serve immediately. OLIVE BRANCHES Spain: The most renowned is the manzanilla (baby apple); a tight, meaty, juicy fresh olive with appealing pale green skin (the one that features in Martinis). The very big green ones are Gordals (gordo is Spanish for fat). Arbequinas are very small, tasty green olives from Cataluna.

NA	The street and social enterprise 21st August 2012 by Robert Ashton I'm in Lisbon. I mention this not to boast about my summer holiday, but because what I've just seen doesn't happen in the UK. Well, not as starkly. You see we're more politically correct than Portugal. We also (for now anyway) have a more sophisticated social support system. I'm sitting at a pavement cafe in the middle of the city. It's busy, the weather's hot and people are happily paying a premium price to sit on the street, rather than inside. As an aside, I like the idea of flexible pricing. To drink at the bar costs least, at a table a little more and outside at a table on the street, most of all. Lesson One: charge the most for the most popular experience. But I'm distracted by a beggar hobbling along the street. He has what might politely be described a withered leg. He shuffles along in a crouched manner, using his right hand to lift and step along his right foot. The leg is painfully thin; a feature accentuated by his baggy, striped shorts. He proffers a plastic beaker and asks for coins. Most are dismissive; he shuffles away. Behind him buskers perform. They're not particularly talented, but they do add something to the ambience of the moment. If nothing else, they make the higher priced pavement table experience more enjoyable. They pause a while and one walks from table to table. He holds out his hat into which everyone drops a few coins. Lesson Two: the more effort you make, the more money you will make. That is, providing you are offering something people want. You see the beggar was relying on me feeling guilty. I have strong legs compared to him. He was selling guilt and the buskers music. If he'd played an instrument, sung a song, told a joke or shined a few shoes, he'd have fared better. But he didn't. And so we come to the point. Anyone today who relies on making you feel guilty for a living will fail. Anyone who expects people to give unconditionally will also fail. That's not to say that philanthropy is dead; more that you need to add value to the giving experience. Deliver a service, add value and people will do business with you. It's why people buy second hand books from Oxfam, read them and then re-donate so the book can be purchased and read again. For all the hype of the social enterprise revolution, it really is often as simple as that.

Follow him on Twitter @robertashton1 1 Comment The big problem is that too many 'social enterprises' became fixated on winning contracts from the state, rather than providing affordable services people need and want. Too often these 'contracts' were really only the old grants but with a bit of make up and a clean top. Looking for gaps in the market -- or worse still whole markets where ordinary people are ripped off by the private sector -- and filling them with more suitable products was seen as more difficult that a cosy relationship with the public sector. Of course, now the relationship with the public sector is less cosy -- but many 'social enterprises' do not have the skills to produce goods and services which people are willing to buy.
IN	This special issue of the International Journal of Technology Policy and Law will consider recent discussions internationally about how to reconfigure communication regulation to account for the impact of media convergence. Three drivers of such changes include: (1) the uncoupling of media content from specific media platforms, whereas much media regulation is platform-based; (2) the increasingly complex question of who is a media content provider, given the rise of content intermediaries such as Google, as well as the rapid growth of user-created or 'amateur' media content; and (3) how to achieve regulatory parity between media companies based within particular nation-states and global media companies. Papers will consider transformations in the media environment associated with convergent media policies and the rise of social media. They will consider the extent to which common regulatory challenges, such as the future of copyright law and the rise of global media platforms, are generating the diffusion of policy innovations in the communications sphere, particularly around responses that focus upon regulatory design and behavioral change rather than black-letter law, and media content rules applied by government regulatory agencies, or ad hoc interventions by content intermediaries themselves. Papers will consider these issues from the perspective of both developed and developing nations. Submissions should be in the form of an MS Word file attached to an email to Professor Terry Flew (t.flew@qut.edu.au).

NA	When it comes to recycling, the Germans are worth their weight in gold Germany continues to show itself to be one of the most forward-thinking and environmentally conscious countries in the world. And recycling is where it all starts. There are many stereotypes about the Germans. And many of the clichs do have a strong element of truth, or so I'm told. Even the one about the towels and the sunloungers. The Germans are stiff and humourless, apparently. But then again it's all relative. Angela Merkel may be more stiff and formal than Silvio Berlusconi, but is probably more relaxed and easy going than Mario Monti. The stereotype that many of us have is that Germans are hardworking, efficient and disciplined  -- but perhaps what not everyone knows is that they apply this efficiency to environmental issues with an impressive pragmatism. Take recycling. Germany is one of the European Union's top recyclers, sending less than 3% of it's waste to landfill. In contrast the worst offenders are Bulgaria, which sends 100% of its waste to landfill, and Cyprus, which creates the most rubbish per person (760kg a year). The European Union's executive has classified Germany's recycling policies as exemplary, and would like other European countries to follow suit. And how has Germany done it? Well, partly through a combination of restrictions and fees. But also through the creation of a thriving recycling industry and many jobs to boot. Following the EU waste management report, which had been so full of praise for Germany, BUND, the German Friends of the Earth, came forward to claim that the statistics do not give the full picture. They made the point that saving garbage from landfill often involves incineration (since only around 50% of waste in Gemany is recycled, impressive though that figure is). BUND explain that incineration is a waste of resources, since the amount of heat produced by burning the waste compares woefully with the huge amount of resources that went into producing the materials that form the waste. According to BUND, we should deal with materials that we no longer require using the following options: reuse, recycle, and only then dispose (the last resort). They also made the point that to compare all EU countries by these criteria does not take into account the fact that some countries are much poorer, and therefore have a much smaller budget for environmental protection. So what about Britain? The UK landfills around 15% more municipal waste than the EU average, and also has lower recycling and composting rates than the EU average. Which is pretty shameful. In order to see what we could be doing better, let's take a closer look at how the Germans do it. If you think of the key elements in terms of reducing landfill waste, they boil down to waste avoidance, waste recovery and environmentally compatible disposal. The Germans' most successful strategy has been to incorporate waste avoidance into industry, making waste management effectively invisible, as corporations are forced to re-think their packaging in order to meet certain standards. The idea that private industries, the 'waste creators' are responsible for eliminating waste, suddenly seems a lot more logical than the 'consumer pays' concept that we are more familiar with, where the taxpayer foots the bill for waste management. Germany also has the Green Dot Trademark, which is something that manufacturers can print on their packaging if they are a member of the DSD, a non-profit organization that charges them fees based on the materials that make up the packging, and how easy or difficult they are to recycle. The Green Dot trademark in turn helps citizens to recycle their waste more easily as they can follow a colour code on the packaging that matches the colour of the recycling bin they need to put it in. Although the Germans are not legally obliged to sort out their household waste, the vast majority are happy to do so and often help out foreigners or others who they see aren't doing it right. People often also return bottles or containers to the shop where they purchased them and get a discount off their next purchase, giving people an extra incentive to recycle. By 2020, Germany aims to find a way of reusing 100% of what it is producing, making the country 100% sustainable, and preventing the need for landfill sites to exist. This is clearly an ambitious goal and likely to result in many challenges for German citizens, government and industry. But it's an impressive goal and shows the direction in which we should be heading.There's certainly a lot we can learn from Germany when it comes to recycling.
IN	During the middle years mathematics methods class (EMTH 215-030) in the of Winter 1999 at the University of Regina, 30 students worked in small groups gathering data on their group members, and then each group developed a story context that was meaningful to them. Within this context they creating a problem, which represented a real-world situation and addressed Saskatchewan middle years mathematics content. Each problem was given to other groups to solve, each group solving at least two other problems. The "solving" groups provided feedback to the problem creators, and the "creators" then altered their problem according to the feedback they received. Each group reflected on the different processes of a) posing a problem, b) solving a problem, c) providing feedback on a problem, and d) accepting feedback and changing parts of the original problem. All of these different processes were carried out in the same grouping arrangements. Lastly, each group had to submit to the course instructor the 're-worked' problem, a summary of feedback from others, reflections on the different processes, how their problem might be used in the middle years curriculum. Below are the eight problems developed by the groups in the class. In solving the problems created by others, each group was asked to consider the following. Was there misleading or deliberate irrelevant information provided? What did you do with this information? Was this an interesting problem to solve? Did you enjoy trying to solve this problem? Why or why not? Did you successfully solve the problem? Did you solve it more than one way? Comment on the problem's creativity. Comment on how well you worked as a group in solving the problem. Can you offer suggestions to improve the wording of the problem to make it easier/harder/more interesting, etc.? We ask you the teachers, and, in turn, your students, to work through the following problems and address the above ten items. We, the students of EMTH 215, section 30, would like your feedback on our problems. We would also like to provide you with feedback on your strategies and solutions. We will write back to you or we will e-mail you to give you feedback on how you solved our problems. We will be pleased to communicate with you. If you want to talk about a specific problem given below, then simply give the students' names, and make sure you write EMTH 215-030 in your communication with Math Central. Also, be sure to give your names and your teacher's name(s). Carlie, Kelly, and Kendra went to McDonald's. It was lunch hour and they were all hungry and in a hurry. Between the three of them they ordered: a Big Mac, a cheeseburger, a McChicken, and a Quarter Pounder. They also ordered a small, large, and super size fries along with two drinks. Can you figure out what each girl had for lunch using the following clues??? 1) Kendra had two burgers. 2) Kelly didn't have a Big Mac. 3) Carlie had a McChicken. 4) The person who had the Diet Coke had the Quarter Pounder. 5) Only two girls ordered drinks. 6) The person who had the McChicken had a strawberry shake. 7) Kendra was short on change so she couldn't afford a drink. 8) The person who had the Quarter Pounder didn't have super size fries. 9) The person who did not have a drink had large fries. "WE'D LIKE TO ORDER PIZZA, PLEASE" Ruth van Mossel Adema, Helen Molloy, Sherry Sunderland Grade Level: Grades 8, 9 and higher level grade 7 Number of Students Who Should Work Together on this Problem: Individuals or small groups of two or three solvers. Problem: Sherry, Ruth and Helen were getting together over supper to work on their math homework. In order to save time, they decided to have pizza delivered. They agreed to order a medium size "Canadian" pizza (pepperoni, back bacon & mushrooms). The students checked prices listed in the Yellow Pages of their phone directory. They found that Dominators Pizza sold a medium "Canadian" for $14.55; Pizza Palace sold one for $9.95; Luigis sold a medium for $15.45. Sherry began to phone Pizza Palace - their pizza looked like the cheapest to her. All 3 girls go to the mall to shop. By the end of the day, each girl has purchased one item. Later in the month, Shannon guesses that her credit card statement will be $900.00, Maria's is $500.00 and Jodie's is $625.00. A shirt at $85.00, jeans at $100.00 and shoes at $40.00 were purchased. Shannon loves her new shirt, but what is her actual balance with interest? Maria looks great in her new jeans, but what is her new total? Jodie is stylish in her new boots, but what is her new credit card debit? Please remember that interest is not charged on the new purchases. Donna, Stephanie, Christine and Melanie went away for the summer of 1998. They all needed to be back in Regina before their first day of school, on September 7. Each person left her vacation spot on August 5, at 8:00 a.m. Regina time. With a group of three other friends, ride along with one of the four girls on their way back to school (in your group of four, one person should do part A, one person part B, one person part C, and one person part D). A) Donna left Ottawa in her sporty black family car at a speed of 100 km\h, and drove a total distance of 2781 km. For every 2 hours she drove, she had to stop for 15 minutes to have a potty break with her 3-year-old son. Being a good mom, Donna also stopped each night for bedtime at 8:00 p.m. and started again at 6 a.m. B) Stephanie "the speed-demon" left from Calgary at 7:00 a.m. with a distance of 792 km\h to cover. She was travelling at a speed of 120 km\h, but she did slow down to 100km\h each time she approached a radar zone. She passed through 4 of them that were each 10 km long. C) Christine, afraid of heights, decided to fly home from Montreal, which was a distance of 2980 km. The plane traveled at a speed of 1200km\h. However, the flight crew, in their haste, forgot to fill the plane with enough gas to make it to Regina, so the pilot had to make an emergency stop in Winnipeg, where they were delayed for 5 hours. D) Melanie left from Dawson City, Yukon, cycling at an average speed of 120 km\day. She had a distance of 3600 km to cover. On one occasion, she had to back track 20 km due to a forest fire. She rested for 72 kh in Whitehorse and hitched a ride with Monty the truck driver and his one eyed dog Flash, who drove for 48 h averaging a speed of 800km\day. On what day, and at what time would each of the travelers arrive in Regina? Meet back with your friends to talk about parts A, B, C, and D above. Which girl arrived back in Regina first? Who got back second? Who was the third to get back and who got back last? Who did you think would be the first to arrive in Regina? Were you surprised? Lisa and Lesley are life guarding at Regina Beach one hot summer day. Shalyn and Erica decided to catch some rays on their rubber raft. Suddenly a wind came up and knocked Shalyn and Erica off their raft into the water. Stranded in the middle of the lake, Lesley and Lisa must come to their rescue. The beach is 40 km across. Lisa is on the east side of the beach 2m in shore. Lesley is guarding on the west side of the beach, 15m in shore. Both are at the boundary of the beach. Shalyn and Erica are 130m off shore and directly in front of Lesley. Lisa can swim at 70m\min and Lesley can swim 80m\min. Both can run on the beach at the same speed they swim. Who will get to Shalyn and Erica first and how long will it take them? Frances, Andrea, Patrice and Jenn were on a shopping trip in Niagara Falls, Ontario. On the last morning of their trip, Frances was glancing at the plane tickets and realized that their flight from Toronto was leaving at 11:15 a.m. and not 1:00 p.m. as originally thought. Is it possible that they could make their flight to Regina, Saskatchewan if it's already 8:30 in the morning? How fast would they have to drive in order to get to Toronto, and on the plane, if Toronto is 243 km away? Things to consider: Leave 10 minutes for packing Leave 10 minutes to fill the gas tank and use the washroom. Leave 5 minutes to catch the flight. Leave 10 minutes for a speeding ticket. Lo and behold, all of the teachers got jobs but none of the aspiring teachers got jobs in the grade they wanted, and none ended up teaching the same grade. With the following clues can you figure out which school division each teaches for, which grade they teach, and which subject they ended up teaching. 1. His Grade 9 math class is currently doing problem solving. 2. One of the teachers ended up teaching in the Yukon, another is teaching in Australia, one is teaching in the Regina Public School Board, and the last one is teaching in the Regina Catholic School Board. 3. The health teacher does not teach the lowest grade. 4. Carrie meets Lynell every Wednesday at Boston Pizza for supper, right after school. One Wednesday night Carrie and Lynell discussed the paintings Carrie had created with her students. 5. The social studies teacher had his Grade 7 students study why they had daylight all day in the summer time where they lived. 6. Corey is always very concerned about his health and well being. 7. Mike tends to his huskies every day; sometimes they are his only means of transportation. 8. Lynell likes painting. 9. No teacher teaches the same subject as another teacher, the subjects they teach are art, math, health and social. 10. Lynell attends Holy Trinity Catholic Church every Sunday to set a good example for her students. James, Larry, Jodie, and Shauna are planning a trip to Toronto to see the Blue Jays play. They each need to have $2000 saved in order to go. The difficulty is that they all make various amounts of money, work different amounts of hours, and have different living expenses. James works at a Data Center 25 hours a week and earns $14.50/hr. Larry works for the Department of Highways and earns $15.00/hr., working 40 hours a week. Jodie is proprietor and makes $292.50 before taxes each week. Shauna works at Sasktel 50 hours a week earning $17.50/hr. After 40 hours she gets paid time and a half. Each person gives 15% to the government in the form of taxes each month. Due to their different living arrangements, they each can save different amounts of money. Jodie can put away 35%, James can put away 27%, Larry can put away 20% and Shauna can put away 14% each month after taxes have been deducted. In what month and week can they all travel together to Toronto if they begin saving on February 14, 1999?
IN	Back in August I shared details of the first ever 'Visualized' conference. The event has been taking place in New York over the past couple of days and so I wanted to share some quick reflections from what has been a fantastic event. The thing that most attracted me about this event was a sense that it would offer a unique blend of different stories and design contexts. I prefer events that are going to introduce me to new ideas and inspirations, rather than being completely coterminous with my current experiences: a dominant feature of the Malofiej conference I was part of and thoroughly enjoyed back in March. It felt like an ideal supplement to the successful Eyeo Festival . It didn't disappoint. The variety and quality of work and ideas on show was terrific. It's fair to say the balance of work being showcased was probably more on the creative, emotive and abstract end of the spectrum rather than the pragmatic and analytical side, but I was hoping for that. It wasn't just the quality of the speakers but the balance and the clustering of their talks. The agenda for the day was very straightforward but ultimately one of its key attributes was the schedule, fixed around rapid 20 minute, single message presentations which was, for me, the optimum speed, duration and frequency. The organisers clearly helped to shape the content with a strong focus on ideas above pitching -- very refreshing and welcome. Apart from missing a couple of the early talks, I did try to keep something of an account of the main themes and observations emerging from the day. Below is a storify widget of my main tweets as I'm sure you will want to relive them all over again! I would also recommend checking out the stream of Scientific American's Jen Christiansen who did a great job of summarising the talks. Despite the significant logistical challenge posed to the organisers, speakers and attendees, there was very little visible impact and this is to the credit of those working incredibly hard behind the scenes to keep everything visibly smooth. In total I would predict there were maybe 300+ attendees across the two days, its hard to say, but there weren't many empty seats, if that is a guide. Aside from the occasional technical challenge -- an issue common to all events it seems -- it was a perfect venue: the Times Center theatre was comfortable and ideally suited to such content. All in all a wonderful event. Great to meet so many new and old friends, a terrifically attentive, respectful and positive atmosphere. This is an event that I hope will continue to have a frequent presence on the conference event calendar. This interactive/animated piece tells an interesting story about the industrial and economic dynamics of Britain from the industrial age to the modern day. The inclusion of key historical or social milestones is a useful device to learn about some of the key catalysts for growth or expansion. The data is taken from a dataset compiled and published on the Guardian Datablog containing all of the rail stations currently operating in the UK. You'll notice stylistic similarities with Derek Watkins ' Posted ' project (visualising expansion of post offices across the US), which is a piece the designers reference as being an inspiration. At the end of each month I pull together a collection of links to some of the most relevant, interesting or thought-provoking web content I've come across during the previous month. If you follow me on Twitter you will see many of these items shared as soon as I find them. Handsome Atlas | Wonderful collection of graphics and visualisation -- 'The Amazing and Incredible Statistical Atlases of the United States of America compiled in the final decades of The Nineteenth Century' | Gallery In the build up to next week's US presidential elections, there are naturally many visualisation and infographic projects being released. A couple of contrasting projects have caught my eye about the ideological breakdown of the US Congress. The image below takes snippets from this work, which is actually a poster that can be purchased. You can take a zoom look at it in close up here . As ever with Timeplots posters there is an INCREDIBLE amount of detail and care taken over every pixel of information being presented. Then, we have a piece done by xkcd.com showing the ebb and flow of partisan attitudes down the years for both the Senate and House. Click on the image to bring up a full version and a large resolution graphic to allow you to see the similar level of fine detail here. Here are a close up of the two main legends on this graphic which attempt to aid understanding. These are both important pieces in demonstrating that sometimes visualisations have to be complex in order to preserve the essence of the data and story being told. Not everything has to be instant, not everything has to be 'got' in 5 seconds. Like the written word, somethings (like instructions) need to be clear, concise and rapidly digested and others, like novels, can be much more considered and slowly-immersed works. However, the critical point of this experiential process is when you pass the initial 'form' judgment -- how attracted have you been to the work, has it grabbed your attention, does it offer a subject matter on which you have an interest to learn/read about. This is where we move into the functional stage and where we need to start to feel like we are going to get something out of it. Both these pieces require a great amount of patience and willingness to invest time in learning how to decode and then interpret the graphics. I think the Timeplots piece is much more accessible and therefore effective than the xkcd version with which I struggled quite a bit to get my head round, especially the break-off branches. Its kind of a mixture of a stacked area chart and Sankey diagram so involves a great deal of work to understand, even with the excellent attempt at annotated explanation. This shows the fine balance all designers are faced with when depicting relatively complex data stories. Can you attract the reader through its form, can you keep them there through function and then deliver to them a learning experience. Above is a recording of me using the tool earlier. You can zoom in on a location of interest (or your home/current location) and then, using the slider, you can compare the proposed changes with the current boundaries. The subtle switching of focus between blue and red and, most prominently, the two overlayed at the same time is a great solution to this setting. If it was two displays side by side you aren't able to easily compare, if it was the two states permanently overlayed on top of each other it would be too busy and hard to distinguish the fundamental shapes. The slider is the star so a hat tip to James and Oliver for deploying this device. Just want to alert everyone to an exciting and enlightening new blog that has been launched today. National Infographic is the perfectly titled blog of Juan Velasco, the Art Director of National Geographic magazine, and formerly a Graphics reporter at El Mundo (Spain) and the Graphics Art Director at The New York Times. Quite a CV, I'm sure you'll agree. Really delighted to see this being launched, I know from discussions after Malofiej that Juan was contemplating the idea of creating such a platform for showcasing National Geographic's work Here's an outline of the intention behind this blog, in Juan's own words: I decided to start this blog to share a bit of the process, challenges and hopefully successes of creating art, maps and graphics for a broad, international audience. We combine journalism, art and design to turn on the light for our readers and transform difficult concepts into clear, transformative learning experiences. You should really read more from this introductory ' Hello World ' post, describing the work and working process of the National Geogrpahic's award-winning graphics team. Juan's first (proper) post describes the amazing work that goes into a project about the Mustang Caves of Nepal , particularly highlighting the meticulous talents of Fernando Baptista, one of the Senior Graphics Editors. How many of you have heard of the Parsons Journal for Information Mapping (PJIM)? It's a really good digital publication that comes out quarterly and covers data visualisation with articles on both the theoretical side as well as the practical, highlighting new developments, techniques and great projects from around the field. PJIM publishes original essays, academic manuscripts, interactive and non-interactive projects, and project documentation. Our goal -- shared by those submitting to the publication -- is to disseminate knowledge on the theories and applications of information mapping, design, and visualization. So far there have been 4 volumes (2009-2012) with 4 publications per year. Across this period there have been 63 articles, so plenty for anyone to get their teeth in to. And its a freely accessible resource, not locked behind publishers pay walls. In this quarter's edition: (1) The Diagram of Information Visualization , by Gaia Scagnetti, about a installation project which looks at the evolution of the field over the past 5-10 years and creates a time line of some of the most influential events and developments. Just to bring together the fragmented updates into a single announcement, I wanted to publish details of the finalised locations/venues for my forthcoming data visualisation training events that will taken place in November/December. Venue details will be published ASAP for the three US events (Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles) that will be delivered in January 2013. Please note also that, despite appearances, the London event in December will not be like a mini-wedding, no formal dress, drunk relatives or awkward speeches will be necessary. This is a final guest post from Jon Schwabish, an economist and data visualization creator, who has been keeping everybody up to date with the daily goings on at VisWeek. I would like to thank Jon so much for his thorough, enlightening and (from my perspective at least) particularly punctual updates! I really appreciate how hard it is to find the time, energy and will to do this on a daily basis at such a all-consuming event like this. You can reach him at jschwabi@yahoo.com or by following him on Twitter @jschwabish . I'll call this post "Final Thoughts". I left Visweek yesterday after the morning sessions, which were both great -- an inspiring and beautiful couple of hours in the Artists Meet Visualization session and a practical (and also inspirational) tour with some data visualization practitioners in the Takes from the Trenches session. In this final post, I give you my final thoughts on Visweek from my perspective as a relative outsider to the field. And please get in touch with me if you think I left something out, think I hit it on the head, or think I'm totally wrong and should stick to attending economics conferences from here on out. The Good First, I think the conference organizers did a great job having what I thought were fairly long breaks (about 20 minutes) between sessions. Those breaks allow people to discuss what they've just seen and talk with other people in the field. Second, the Fast Forward sessions were great -- entertaining, quick, lively, and engaging. I wish more conferences that I attend would put on similar events. Third, the people and the energy at Visweek were terrific. (Remember, I spend a lot of time at economics conferences, so it really doesn't take much for me to be impressed on this front.) Even though I'm not an academic data visualization researcher or a full-time data visualization practitioner, I was excited to find so many engaged, interesting people ready to discuss the merits of different types of data visualization, different tools to use (and how to use them), how and why to choose certain visualizations, and so many other aspects of presenting data and information. The Bad First, the internet connection was pretty weak and there was a shortage of places to charge devices. Organizers may want to take a more strategic approach to providing places to power up. Second, I find the organization of the conference is a bit confusing. From discussions with some experienced attendees, it appears that Visweek started as single conference (maybe BioVis?) and then over time added other conferences to it, each of which is organized separately. I initially found it hard to navigate the website and to determine the differences between SciVis, InfoVis, BioVis, etc. I'm aware that Visweek is put together by an outstanding team of volunteers, but I would urge the organizers to consider whether it is worth formally pulling everything together under one umbrella or working to make the distinctions clearer. Third, I want to just reiterate a point I made in my Day 2 summary -- the number of observations in many of the experiments presented at Visweek is very small. I discussed my Day 2 post with a few people at the conference and I heard two main reactions: one, it is difficult to get more participants in these experiments (and cost is certainly be a factor); and second, small sample sizes are characteristic of other fields, such as sociology and psychology, so the practice is not uncommon. And I get those two points and agree, but I do think that if the data visualization field is to determine the best ways to communicate data and information, sample sizes are going to have to get bigger and be more representative in order to perform truly reliable statistical analyses. The Ugly I lost count of how many presentations I saw over the last few days, but I was struck by the poor slide and presentation design of so many speakers. Even if you're a computer scientist studying different algorithm design or a researcher working on different visualization perception issues, Visweek is, at its heart, a conference on visualizing data and, as such, I was really disappointed at the overall quality of the slides. Specifically, I'd like to see fewer bullet points, larger text, more and better images, more narratives, and fewer cute slide transitions. (Some people told me they'd like to cut down on the number of equations -- I'm not turned off by equations, but I do want to hear some discussion and intuition for the math, instead of presenters thinking that the Greek letters are going to do the job for them.) In the Evening I survived my first Visweek! I had a tremendous time and was fortunate to meet so many excellent researchers, graduate students, practitioners, computer scientists, programmers, and graphic designers. Thanks to Andy for letting me invade his site for a few days and special thanks to a whole bunch of folks for inviting me into their world and helping me navigate the waters, if only for a few days: Enrico Bertini, Jerome Cukier, Ellie Fields, Danyel Fisher, Jeff Heer, Noah Iliinsky, Robert Kosara, Jen Lowe, Kevin Lynagh, Scott Murray, Hannah Pileggi, Kim Reese, Jonathan Roberts, and Drew Skau. If you're not familiar with the work of these folks -- and apologies to those I omitted -- I recommend you go find them (and go bother them for help and advice!). So I'm now back east where football is on at a decent hour and there are fewer coffee shops per capita. I'm filled with renewed inspiration to make better and innovative visualizations, and to figure out better ways to communicate information because I believe that communicating data through quality data visualizations can lead to better understanding of complex issues, which will hopefully help us tackle some of the important questions we are all trying to answer. This is a guest post from Jon Schwabish, an economist and data visualization creator. You can reach him at jschwabi@yahoo.com or by following him on Twitter @jschwabish . Many thanks to Job for his efforts to keep us poor folk who aren't able to make it to this great flagship event. Day 3! I've made it through three full days of Visweek and I'm starting to feel like I'm running on fumes. Some nice events today, so let me get to it. In the Morning I was happy to start the morning with the Visweek Papers Fast Forward, which is where the authors for all 40 or so papers get 30 seconds each to advertise their work. It's such a better way to see what's coming than reading abstracts. My first session was the Visweek Industry Presentations: A View for the Future, which included presentations by representatives from Tableau, Kitware, Intel, IBM, and Microsoft Excel. I got the most out of the talk by Scott Ruble from Excel because he did the best job of looking forward -- he discussed the various visualization devices, interaction modes (e.g., touchscreens, voice controls), devices, platforms, and services that he thinks are on the horizon for both developers and users. He also previewed the new Excel 2013, which includes a "Recommended Charts" option as well as some other new visualization tools. You should be able to get a free preview here . Jock Mackinlay did a nice demonstration of Tableau desktop and also gave us a preview of the upcoming mobile version. The second session this morning -- Visual Analytics in Practice -- featured myself, Kevin Lynagh (Kerning Labs) and Shahtab Wahid (Bloomberg). Obviously, this was the best session of the entire week! Kevin's talk was excellent -- solid slides; good, clear message; nice story; and good advice to students and practitioners. Shahtab's talk was an interesting look at the visual tools and products he's helped developed at Bloomberg. (With respect to my talk -- my slides are available here . I'll just say that I got a lot of great feedback from visualization practitioners and academics alike, and I'm looking forward to heading back to DC with new tools to try, strategies to consider, and people to bother for help). Things I Missed in the Morning I wasn't able to see everything this morning, but it was clear from the #Visweek Twitterfeed that there are three papers I need to check out: 1. Nicholas Kong and Maneesh Agrawala presented a paper on graphical overlays that are layered onto charts to "facilitate a larger set of chart reading tasks". 2. The Typographic Map tool by Shehzad Afzal and others, with which you can make maps that merge text and spatial data. You can play with it here . 3. Justin Talbot, John Gerth and Pat Hanrahan's paper that shows William Cleveland's Banking to 45 aspect ratio design guideline might not actually be minimized around 45 or, as it became to be called here, Clevelandgate. In the Afternoon So after my talk and a tasty lunch in Capitol Hill, I was kind of in and out of sessions this afternoon. The tutorial on color theory by Theresa-Marie Rhyne was too technical for me. The panel on Reproducible Visualization Research was more interesting and appears to highlight challenges in the academic community that many fields face. Specifically, the panel was charged with discussing what changes might be needed to visualization research to assure greater reproducibility. Although there are parts of the data visualization field that have been around for a while, much of it is fairly young, so this may just be part of the field's growing pains. I mean, the American Economic Association only introduced a disclosure policy in July 2012. I did spend a lot of time in the afternoon talking to a lot of great people -- practitioners, academics, programmers, and other people interested in ways in which basic data visualization strategies can be taught to researchers and analysts who may not be as familiar with the available data visualization tools and strategies. In the Evening I spent about an hour standing by my poster during the Poster Viewing and talked to a lot of people, some of whom were interested in what tools I use to create infographics, how I go about deciding which charts to use for the data at hand, strategies on how to make a good infographic, and how the infographics are used. So that's all for today. Unfortunately, I leave around noon tomorrow, so I only get to see a couple of things in the morning, but I'll follow it up with some summary thoughts.
IN	Climate Change Cluedo: Anthropogenic CO2 Posted on 25 July 2012 by Tom Curtis Anthropogenic CO2? The human-caused origin (anthropogenic) of the measured increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 is a cornerstone of predictions of future temperature rises.  As such, it has come under frequent attack by people who challenge the science of global warming.  One thing noteworthy about those attacks is that the full range of evidence supporting the anthropogenic nature of the CO2 increase seems to slip from sight.  So what is the full range of supporting evidence ?  There are ten main lines of evidence to be considered: 1) The start of the event Annual emissions of CO2 by human use of fossil fuels rose from 3 million tonnes of Carbon (11 million tonnes of CO2) in 1751 to 54 million tonnes of Carbon (198 million tonnes of CO2) in 1850.  After that fossil fuel use rose sharply so that by 2008, annual emissions (including from cement manufacture) had risen to 8749 million tonnes of Carbon (32 billion tonnes of CO2).  The rise in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 also began around 1750 and has followed the emissions up.  This extraordinary coincidence strongly suggests that anthropogenic emissions are the cause of the rise in CO2 concentration. 3) The mass balance Over the course of the twentieth century, the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere measured in tonnes has been less than anthropogenic emissions in every year, and has averaged only 56% of anthropogenic emissions over the period from 1850-2005.  Indeed, growth in atmospheric emissions probably has not exceeded anthropogenic emissions since the early 1880s, approximately the time anthropogenic emissions reached the equivalent of 0.45 ppmv of atmospheric concentration.  It is interesting to note that the airbourne fraction, ie, the atmospheric increase divided by total emissions, has increased slightly in recent times.  This means that natural carbon reservoirs have acted as a net sink over the course of the 20th century, and strongly indicates that the source of the increase in CO2 concentration is anthropogenic . 4) Declining C14 ratio Carbon 14 is formed in the atmosphere by collisions between cosmic rays and Nitrogen.  It has a very short half life (5,730 years), but atmospheric C14 is continuously replenished, maintaining a near constant concentration.  Buried C14 is not replenished, however.  As a result, whether from volcanoes or fossil fuels, CO2 from long-buried sources has effectively no C14.  The addition of large quantities of CO2 from a long-buried source to the atmosphere will result in a significant decline in C14 concentration in the atmosphere, which is what we see.  More recent, high precision measurements show the decline in C14 continued after the end of atmospheric nuclear testing.This is strong evidence that the source of the increased concentration of CO2 is fossil carbon, either from volcanoes or from fossil fuels. 5) Declining C13/C12 ratio Carbon has two stable varieties (isotopes), C12 an C13.  Because C13 has an extra neutron, it is heavier.  In photosynthesis, most plants find it easier to take up the lighter C12, and do so at a higher rate than they take up C13, with the result that carbon compounds formed from the products of photosynthesis, including plants, animals and fossil fuels have a lower C13 to C12 ratio than does the atmosphere.  Introducing a large quantity of CO2 derived from photosynthesis would cause the  C13/C12 ratio to decline.  In contrast, CO2 introduced from volcanoes or from outgassing from the ocean would not significantly affect the C13/C12 ratio.  In fact the global C13/C12 ratio has declined, which is very strong evidence the source of the CO2 increase has was C12 enriched, ie, derived from photosynthesis.  Therefore it is very strong evidence that it comes from the biosphere or fossil fuels, rather than from volcanoes or oceanic outgassing. 6) Declining oxygen concentration Because the change in solubility of O2 in water with change in temperature significantly differs from that of CO2, the change in O2 concentration is not affected by other possible CO2 sinks. That means the decline in CO2 concentration means any large unknown natural sources of CO2 must not come from a source of combustion but must come from a low C14 source generated by photosynthesis. These facts together almost completely preclude the existence of such putative natural sources. Because of the importance of the O2 decline, it is worthwhile looking at the chart below from the IPCC TAR which shows it: The observed decline in O2 is straightforward. The diagonal arrow from the start point marked "fossil fuel burning" represents the expected change in CO2 and O2 concentrations from known fossil fuel consumption. The arrow marked "ocean uptake" represents the uptake of CO2 by the ocean, which does not affect the O2 level. The arrow marked "land uptake" is the uptake of CO2 and release of O2 by photosynthesis, which also decreases the CO2 concentration and increases the O2 concentration. Finally, the small arrow marked "outgassing" represents outgassing of O2 from the ocean, which does not affect CO2 concentration. That outgassing is partly the result of a warming ocean, and partly a result of the very slight decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere. These factors are reasonably, but not exactly known. It is important to note that because the fall in O2 concentration is significantly less than that predicted from known combustion of fossil fuels, the uptake of CO2 by photosynthesis must exceed the combustion or decay of modern organic material from either anthropogenic (Land Use Changes) or natural sources. 7) Increasing CO2 concentrations in the ocean Simultaneously with the rise in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, the concentration of CO2 (and its equilibrium products) in the ocean has been increasing .  The rise in CO2 in the ocean is referred to as an increase in the "partial pressure" of CO2, and results in a simultaneous decline in the partial pressure of Hydrogen (pH), ie, an increase in the ocean's acidity .  If the amount of CO2 in the ocean was falling, the partial pressure of CO2 would be falling, and the pH rising.  This is very strong evidence that oceanic outgassing is not the cause of the rise in atmospheric CO2. Scientists have used a variety of methods to determine the CO2 emissions from volcanoes.  A common method is to use a tracer gas, ie, a gas emitted from volcanoes but which does not stay in the atmosphere for long.  Determining the emissions rates of the tracer gas from volcanoes, together with the concentration of those gases in the atmosphere allows the overall level of volcanic activity to be measured.  Once that is measured, measurements determining average rates of CO2 emissions for a given amount of activity can be used to determine the global CO2 emissions from volcanoes.  Other techniques are used to measure CO2 emissions from volcanoes, mid-ocean ridges and subduction zones under the sea.  The emissions, from all volcanoes, both on land and under sea, are about one hundredth of anthropogenic emissions .  While there may be some error in the estimates, it is unlikely that the error would be large enough for volcanoes to be emitting a sizable fraction of anthropogenic emissions.  That strongly suggests volcanic emissions are not the source of the increased CO2 concentration . 9)  Known changes in biomass Anthropogenic Emissions from Land Use change and deforestation represent 10% of all human emissions ( 0.9 PgC of 10 PgC ). Over the last century, human-caused deforestation and other land use changes have been by far the largest cause of change in land cover, and hence natural changes cannot be significantly larger than that.( Source )  Indeed, as discussed regarding the declining oxygen concentration, that decline together with the land uptake shows that the biosphere is a net sink for CO2. 10) Past changes in CO2 concentration During past "ice ages" (glacials) CO2 concentrations have correlated with temperature, with approximately a 22 ppmv increase in CO2 for every 1 degree increase in temperature.  In more recent historical times, there was an increase in CO2 concentration during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) relative to the Little Ice Age (LIA) of about 10 ppmv for approximately a 1 degree C change in temperature.  Given that global temperatures have increased by 0.7 C since 1850, we would expect an increase in CO2 concentration of between 7 and 15 ppmv based on historical precedents.  That CO2 concentrations have increased by approximately 110 ppmv over that period is very strong evidence that the source of the increase was not outgassing from the ocean. Playing Climate Change Cluedo As a child I enjoyed playing Cluedo (Clue in the US market).  I soon learned you discovered more from the questions people did not respond to than from those that they did, and developed a matrix from which to plot responses and non-responses.  Filling in the matrix soon honed in on the correct answer, who killed whom, with what and where.  Science is sometimes like that.  The lines of evidence are the questions we put, and if we plot out our matrix, it quickly becomes clear that it is the humans who have caused the rise in CO2 levels, by burning fossil fuels in the twentieth century.  Every other hypothesis makes a host of predictions that do not pass the test of the evidence. Comments (flame) so the ratio of 6/10 vs 1/10 makes AGW only 6 times more likely than GW if one prefers to look only the positive evidence. F.e. who has measured all the ratios of C isotopes from submarine ridges? And there might be ultra-sulfuric low-activity shield volcanoes near upwelling regions making the ocean more acidic. Has the sun produced more 13/14C(4+) that has hit the Earth in recent years? Is the sun transitioning to the alpha2 process (or what ever it was that involved Carbon fusion) and going to He burning??? OMG, we're all gonna die!!!(/flame) (no explanation for the rising [CO3(2-)] though.) Thanks, I guess this list of evidence is pretty extensive, and might be worth a quicklink. Does anybody come up more examples of the evidence of the source of the extra carbon in the atmosphere/ocean? For my part, after 5) had been solved 1999abouts I've seen nothing to doubt the Anthropogenic part of the GW, though I accept the deforestation is a part (and it's mostly anthropogenic too.) well done! It's things like this that sealed the case for AGW in my mind - you've presented 10 solid lines of evidence linking fossil fuel emissions to rising atmospheric CO2. One might imagine that a handful of those evidences are critically flawed, but that still leaves multiple independent justifications intact. To doubt the conclusion, you'd have to explain, not just why ALL the pieces of evidence are flawed, but how the flaws coincidentally line up in favor of the same conclusion. This would take considerably more work than the average fake skeptic is willing to invest. And when you move beyond "Emissions =&gt; CO2 Rise" to other core tenants of AGW, you see similar lists of solid, independent evidences (NOAA's graphics on signs of a warming world and human fingerprints on warming come to mind). I really don't see how someone can look at this and not, at least provisionally, accept the obvious conclusions. This is a question I run into surprisingly often. Thanks for putting the answers all in one place. There is physically no way that the rise isn't being caused by humans. Anyone who sees the mass balance emasurements and then accepts claims that it's a natural rise really needs their skepticism checking. The mass balance shows that for the rise to be natural, one or both of these things must be happening: 1) maths is wrong and bigger numbers are actually smaller than smaller numbers or 2) chemistry is wrong and molecules of carbon dioxide magically disappear in the atmosphere. That's the sort of hypothesis that's needed for a natural rise in CO2 to be logically consistent. The fact that so many 'skeptics' argue it's natural is absolutely incredible to me! Well, I'm pretty much of the same opinion, since I know no one who has extracted the steel and chrome and oil needed to plastics from the ground, and who has built, f.e. a car from these, literally from scratch. Some people might argue learning is natural for humans, and that the products made with the skills acquired from learning are thus also natural, but I'm more old fashioned with my definitions and append these things to culture, since the support structure to build something from scratch (i.e. from the elements that have not been modified by other humans), is likely to involve some sort of culture. To take an example, f.e. I couldn't build even a wooden bow naturally, for I do not have the skills to weave a strong string from the wool that I could get from lambs by some stone tools I can make (I've not done any refining of metals though I know the principle (that I couldn't have found out by myself (the lake/swamp ore process)). But all of the above depends on the various uses of 'natural' that are not connected to the scientific evidence presented here, but are likely more of a subject of philosophy and semantics... I don't understand how the amount of O decline has been quantified in 6). In particular "fossil fuel burning" arrow covers 30ppm on CO2 axis but more than 40ppm on O axis. That sounds incorrect, because according to the obvious reaction: C + O2 -&gt; CO2 O2 & CO2 are matched molecule for molecule, so deltas in O2 & CO2 should be the same. Am I missing something here? 1) "C components of fossil fuels burning", which would form an isosceles triangle 30ppm x 30ppm 2) "H components of fossil fuels burning", which would be vertical arrow as it does not produce CO2 It would be clearer for me and would also indicate the difference between CO2 emmissions from burning pure coal vs. carobhydrates. Regardeless my comment herein, I join my predecessors in praising the value of this article: this is the best summary of arguments why humans are controling CO2. The AGW linking piece (CO2 rise=&gt;warming) was best explained by Richard Alley in AGU 2009. Do you have a citation for your Oxygen Depletion understanding... one complete with actual numbers? Nothing is ever "just this one cause," and the conversion of CH4 + O2 to CO2 and H2O is an ongoing natural process that gets H2O into the upper atmosphere. The question becomes one of simple math... how much O2 does the increase in the amount of CH4 (presumably from anthropogenic sources) consume, and how does this compare with the total oxygen depletion. Without those numbers, and a citation, your statement is pure speculation. But I strongly doubt that the numbers balance, or that fossil fuel combustion fails to dwarf the upper atmosphere methane contribution. Observations of ozone show a thinning of the Earth's protective stratospheric ozone layer by about 3 to 8% overall since the 1970s. In the upper stratosphere, ozone depletion has been from 15 to 20%. Again, the model is better able to reproduce these values when increased water vapor is included. This is especially true in the upper stratosphere, where ozone is most sensitive to water. The model indicates that increased water vapor accounts for about 40% of the ozone loss in the upper stratosphere, and about 20% of the overall loss to date. There are two driving forces behind the change in stratospheric moisture. Increasing emissions of methane are transformed into water in the stratosphere by chemical reactions. This can account for about a third of the observed increase in moisture there. http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/shindell_05/ Why did you change topics to ozone? We were discussing O2 depletion in the entire atmosphere, and I presume (because we are on the topic of this post) as an indicator of an anthropogenic cause of CO2 increase. Any casual reader of your comment is going to interpret it in that fashion, and your comment suggests oxygen depletion is not an indicator of an anthropogenic source of CO2 increase. As such, you need to support the claim. Your shift to ozone depletion has no bearing whatsoever on the matter, and dodges the point. Your explanation of the chemistry is similarly irrelevant. I well understand the reaction, and anyone who doesn't can google it quickly enough. But you still haven't provided the necessary foundation for your argument, which is observational and computational evidence not merely that the reaction occurs (as it does naturally and continuously), but also that the mass balance involved, as compared to fossil fuel combustion, is high enough to diminish the argument in the original post. You've failed to do so. I'll give you a second chance, or dismiss your statement as unsubstantiated noise. Chris@...multiples: It *generally* does not look very good, to contantly cite Wikipedia as a *primary* source of data. Nothing wrong with using it here and there but in addition to your dodging Sphaerica's direct questions, I would think you'd use more academic sources to back up what you posit. "In this case, the reactive hydrogen exists in the form of two liberated OH (hydroxyl radical) molecules which become the catalyst in a pair of reactions with odd oxygen (OX) that result in a net loss of OX, by which we mean a net loss of both ozone molecules and free oxygen atoms." Chris Machens @23, to give your quote in context, it reads as follows: "4.2.3 HOX catalytic cycles -- The importance of these two species, methane and water vapor, in ozone chemistry is that they transport and release hydrogen into the stratosphere. The activated hydrogen that is released can then participate in the destruction of odd oxygen, i.e., ozone, through a variety of catalytic cycles. These reactive hydrogen (HOX) cycles are summarized by Figure 5.15. The open circles show the predominant species in which hydrogen exists in the stratosphere. We have not included H2 (molecular hydrogen), H2O (water vapor), and CH4 (methane) since they are not involved in the fast stratospheric hydrogen photochemistry balance. The arrows with superimposed boxes are reaction pathways. For example, OH (left circle) reacts with O3 to form HO2. The reaction is written OH + O3 --&gt; HO2 + O2 On the figure, we see this represented by the line with the superimposed blue (O, O3) box. The O2 (molecular oxygen) product is not represented, because it is not a hydrogen species. All of the reactions which lead to ozone creation are colored in blue, while ozone photolysis is colored in magenta. Each water vapor molecule can be transformed into two molecules of HOX (reactive hydrogen) through reaction with O atoms via a reaction of water vapor with the singlet D oxygen atom. H2O + O(1D) --&gt; 2 OH Recall that HOX = OH + HO2. In this case, the reactive hydrogen exists in the form of two liberated OH (hydroxyl radical) molecules which become the catalyst in a pair of reactions with odd oxygen (OX) that result in a net loss of OX, by which we mean a net loss of both ozone molecules and free oxygen atoms. OH + O3 --&gt; HO2 + O2 HO2 + O --&gt; OH + O2 ------------------------- NET: O3 + O --&gt; 2 O2 (See Figure 5.15a) Notice that the NET effect of the reactions is simply a conversion of two odd oxygen molecules into two molecules of O2. The sum of reactive hydrogen, OH + HO2, is conserved by this cycle." (Your quote underlined; my bolding) So, in context it is clear that the net reaction to which your refer is the loss of O3 and O and the creation of O2, hardly an explanation for the depletion of O2 from the atmosphere. That section, however, does not refer to section 4.2.2 from which you draw the methane related reactions, so I am unsure why you refer to it, or why Phil drew attention to it. Chris Machens @13 raises an interesting question. Unfortunately he then diverts into a side issue with a discussion of Ozone, which is essentially irrelevant. All we need to recognize is that methane released to the atmosphere will eventually break down to a CO2 molecule and two H2O molecules, consuming two O2 molecules in the process. As CO2 and H2O are the most chemically stable products of the various reaction pathways between CH4 and O2, we can ignore the details. The question then arises, how significant is the release of methane to the depletion in atmospheric O2? Total methane emissions have raised the methane concentration in the atmosphere by approximately 250 parts per billion since 1978. Given that the atmosphere contains approx 1.8 * 10^20 moles, and the molar mass of methane is 16 grams per mole, that represents emissions of 720 million tonnes of methane. Over approximately the same period, humans have used for energy, or flared over 350,000 million tonnes of methane. Thus emissions of methane represent just 0.2% of human consumption of methane . The figures used are conservative, and do not include the fact that much of the methane emission comes from fugutive emissions (gas leaks) from human energy use which are incorporated in the total human consumption. So, while Chris has identified a genuine additional source of O2 depletion, it is too small relative to human use of gas for energy to be noticeable within error; let alone compared to the total use of fossil fuels, of which gas is a very minor component. Though what i meant basically was what Tom points out to me in 26. I checked wiki again and found this "Uncontrolled build-up of methane in Earth's atmosphere is naturally checked -- although human influence can upset this natural regulation -- by methane's reaction with hydroxyl radicals formed from singlet oxygen atoms and with water vapor. " With ozone depletion causes oxygen depletion is the result from the methane -&gt; water vapor - reaction, and then the water vapor in the cold stratosphere destroys ozone. So maybe the ozone destruction doesn't destroy oxygen but it happens before that. Chris Machen @27, Wikipedia lists total methane emissions of 600 teragrams per annum, or 600 million tonnes of methane per annum; and 20 terragrams (million tonnes) increment after sinks are taken into account. Compared to the 2008 fossil fuel plus cement emissions of That is less than the 720 million tonnes 8750 million tonnes, that still only represents 7% for total emissions, or 0.2% for net emissions. Of those emissions, those from wetlands (225 Tg/a), termites (20 Tg/a), ruminants (115 Tg/a), waste treatment (25 Tg/a) and biomass burning (40 Tg/a) are all generated from carbon originally removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis in recent times. As such, the full cycle involves no net change in O2 levels. A further 110 Tg/a comes from fugitive emissions from the fossil fuel industry, and hence are already accounted for as part of total human emissions from fossil fuels. That leaves just 65 of 600 Tg/a that can make an additional contribution to the reduction of O2 levels in the atmosphere. That represents an additional 0.74% O2 reduction from methane emissions. Thus calculated, I can concede the amount is greater than 0.2% - but I certainly cannot see how it could be considered significant. I should note, however, that only clathrates represent emissions of methane which do not derive their carbon from either recent photosynthesis (hence having no net effect) or from fossil fuels (hence already accounted for). Clathrates represent 0.11% of the effect of fossil fuels based on the wikipedia figures. "It is important to note that because the fall in O2 concentration is significantly less than that predicted from known combustion of fossil fuels, the uptake of CO2 by photosynthesis must exceed the combustion or decay of modern organic material from either anthropogenic (Land Use Changes) or natural sources." (Off topic snipped) Moderator Response: TC: Trunkmonkey, the effect on CO2 on plants is not a subject of this post and consequently, this post is off topic. If you wish to raise a particular point about that subject, or if anyone wishes to respond to this post, you can do so where the discussion is on topic . Just how do methanogenic bacteria deplete oxygen? They are strict anaerobes i.e. they grow in the complete absence of oxygen. Most landfills go to great extremes to compact the garbage so that there is very little air space left. Aerobic micro-organisms exhaust this very low amount of oxygen so that the anaerobes can take over. Thus landfills are not responsible for oxygen depletion. Why are you trying to connect all those fringe processes as culprits for oxygen depletion when the gorilla in the room is the burning of fossil fuels? Ian Forrester @31, methane released by anaerobic bacteria in land fills will decay in the atmosphere based on the chemical formula: CH4 + 2 x O2 =&gt; CO2 + 2 x H2O Therefore, typically, each methane molecule released by landfill (or any other source) will deplete the atmosphere of two oxygen molecules. What Chris Machens @31 is neglecting is that carbon in landfill comes essentially from only two sources - fossil fuels either as some form of oil or fuel, or converted into plastics; and biomass in the form of kitchen and garden scraps, or wood, cotton, or wool. Taking the carbon sourced from biomass first, because that carbon was taken from the atmosphere by photosynthesis, in a process that releases oxygen. In fact, photosynthesis in plants follows the formula: 6 x CO2 + 6 x H2O =&gt; C6H12O6 + 6 x O2 showing a deficit of 1 O2 molecule for each carbon atom fixed compared to the equation for the oxidation of methane. However, the process of converting sugar to methane will release an additional net 3 O2 molecules, and gaining the additional two hydrogen atoms, presumably from water, will release yet more oxygen. The net effect on atmospheric O2 levels is neutral. Carbon from fossil fuels is slightly different. In calculating CO2 emissions from fossil fuels, scientists do allow for those fuels turned into stable products such as plastics, which do not decay easily and hence do not release their carbon to the atmosphere. According to Margate et al (1984) They represent about 6.7% of all liquid fossil fuels, and 3.2% of gases. However, relatively volatile products are already included in the accounting, and hence are not a source of additional O2 loss. And the non-volatile products such as plastics do not typically decay, and hence are not the source of methane from land fill. Hence, while some small amount of the methane generated in land fill may not be accounted for in determining the expected O2 loss from fossil fuels, the effect is likely to be very small. It is certainly likely to be smaller than the approximately 10% error margin in estimates of fossil fuel production (Margate et al) and hence of O2 depletion. Chris Machens @30, in addition to my immediately preceding comment, I note that the error in reporting of fossil fuel production is +/- 6% according to one recent report (an improvement on the +/- 10% reported in Margate. That uncertainty passes on to calculations of the depletion of O2. Consequently, discovery of source of O2 depletion not included in IPCC calculations that is less than 0.74% of the calculated value will not change the estimate within error. Chris Machens @34, thanks for the link. It brings out the irony in our discussion that while methane from landfills does not significantly add to the depletion of O2, it still represents a significant environmental threat because of the strong greenhouse effect of methane relative to CO2. As Tom points out, the divergence into Atmospheric Ozone chemistry is irrelevant and bordering on being off-topic, so I'll try to be brief. I think Chris Machens is confused between free Oxygen radicals and an Oxygen molecule. As Bob points out above, The decomposition of O3 results in the creation of O2 molecule and an O* (free radical). These free radicals are extremely unstable and immediately engage in various other reactive pathways, illustrated in the Chapman Chemistry document. Some of these pathways result in further creation of O2 molecules and some of which "trap" oxygen in Nitrous Oxide. So there are three problems with the statement "Ozone depletion also depletes Oxygen molecules", 1. It assumes one of these pathways is favoured over the other, for which no evidence is presented 2. It assumes that the "trapping" of oxygen in Nitrous Oxide is permanent; i.e. the oxygen is not recovered at some later stage. We know NO2 levels in the atmosphere are pretty constant, I would suspect that ocean chemistry (via acidic rain) would be important in this regard 3. Since we know that Ozone creation depletes O2 then the assertion that Ozone destruction does too should raise the question "How come we're still breathing?" :-) Rob Honeycutt @37, firstly, and fairly obviously, the strong correlation between CO2 increases and cumulative human emissions (2), the mass balance (3), the change in the C14/C12 ration (4), the fact that Oxygen levels have declined by less than would be required to explain combustion of fossil fuels (6), and the known record of changes in biomass (9) are all strong evidence against the claim that the CO2 increase is from changes in biomass. More specifically, however, just as the combustion, decay, or respiration of (or by) biomass) will add more C12 than C13 to the atmosphere relative to the existing proportion, so photosynthesis will take out more C12 than C13 by exactly the same amount per tonne of biomass generated. Given that the total amount of biomass in the world is stable, the biosphere can have no net effect on C13/C12 ratios except due to a small deletion of C12 relative to C14 due to biomass lost from circulation by fossilization. Consequently, if the person you are debating wants seriously to argue that the biosphere is the source of the changes in CO2 concentration, they are compelled (if they are consistent) to argue that the biosphere is rapidly shrinking. How rapidly is shown by the fact that the biosphere contains approximately 1,000 billion tonnes of Carbon . (I apologize for referencing wikipedia on this point. Unfortunately searching google scholar simply returned page after page studies into biomass as fuel or as carbon sequestration.) One part per million by volume (PPMV) of CO2 in the atmosphere has a mass of 2.13 tonnes of carbon . That means an increase in CO2 concentration from 280 to 390 ppmv represents 234.3 billion tonnes of Carbon, or over 20% of the world's total biomass. That may seem like to large a decrease to be contemplated, but as it happens, humans have caused the destruction of biomass to the extent of cumulative emissions around 165 billion tonnes of Carbon (17% of the world's total biomass) since 1850 ( Houghton 2008 , extended to 2011 by persistence). The margin of error is certainly large enough that the 20% could come from human activities alone. Of course, the 20% estimate is letting your debate opponent of lightly. It is known that increases in atmospheric CO2 only represent 57% of total human emissions. Consequently, allowing for the extent of emissions not retained by the atmosphere your opponent would need to claim that over 400 billion tonnes of biomass had been lost. What is worse, in order to account for known human emissions and the known increase in the CO2 content of the atmosphere, to claim the increase is primarily from changes in the biosphere, he would need to claim an even larger fraction of emitted CO2 was not retained in the atmosphere. Just to assume 50/50 responsibility, they would need to claim the airborn fraction was just 28% of all emissions, requiring more than 500 billion tonnes emissions from biomass (on top of the human caused emissions). I think we would have noticed. Of course, such a large net combustion of biomass is also going to require a larger net source of oxygen to account for the limited drop on O2 concentrations. I would say that I cannot wait to see what possible sources would be suggested, but I know better. Pseudo-critics of any scientific theory to not feel it incumbent on themselves to flesh out a coherent alternative proposal. They think it is sufficient to say that biomass has the same C13/C12 ratio as fossil fuels (approx true) and think that that is a devastating criticism even though no coherently worked out counter proposal that implies natural changes in biomass is remotely plausible given the sum of the evidence. "The increase in CO2 concentration over the long term (1850-2005) almost exactly correlates (corr.: 0.981; R^2: 0.962) with cumulative anthropogenic emissions from all sources including Land Use Change (LUC). The close correlation has continued in recent times, with a correlation of 0.977 when compared to the Mauna Loa record (r^2: 0.955) . " Immediately after posting, this will be amended to read as follows: "The increase in CO2 concentration over the long term (1850-2005) almost exactly correlates (corr.: 0.997; R^2: 0.993) with cumulative anthropogenic emissions from all sources including Land Use Change (LUC). The close correlation has continued in recent times, with a correlation of 0.9995 when compared to the Mauna Loa record (r^2: 0.999) . " (Emphasis added in both quotes to highlight the amended values.) The figures initially published show the correlation between CO2 concentration and annual emissions, not cumulative emissions as stated. The corrected figures are for cumulative emissions. oh, I think I found out one item missing on the list. The weathering of rocks. I would suspect there hasn't been a change of rate so large in that, and one that would have started when industrial revolution started, that would explain the changed 13/12C ratio. For the sake of completeness this might be included to the list. Oops. Of course the change of rate in weathering should be different to 12C and 13C to explain that. It's quite astonishing the binding sites of enzymes in plants can be so selective they may differentiate between atoms of different nuclear charge distribution (the amount of neutrons and their locations). I'd presume the distribution of charge in the nucleus gets mediated to the exact configuration of molecular orbitals and this is sensed by the appropriate coordinated bonds within the photosynthetic machinery. If one wants to go by with the simple model of atoms based on positive-negative charge, one might think that the distribution of the nuclear charge in 13C gets polarised more to the one side of the nucleus so the electrons on that side would be on thighter orbits than usual. In the case of CO2, the explanation of 12preference in plants in #42, would mean that the central C in O=C=O rotates horizontally along the long axis of the molecule while the slight excess of negative charge would be located perpendicular to it, making the O=13C=O look a bit fatter than O=12C=O. I'm pretty sure there are better explanations about this within physical chemistry, but I'm not that advanced in that discipline. "1st, I see that Mr.Curtis confirmed my point that lower C13/C12 ratio is NOT unique to burning FFs.("just as the combustion, DECAY, or RESPIRATION of (or by) biomass will add more C12? than C13 to the atmosphere" So he tacitly agrees that the CAGW "unique FF fingerprint" meme is false. He argues that the biosphere cannot be the source of the increased CO2 in the atmos b/c "PHOTOSYSTHESIS WILL TAKE OUT MORE C12 THAN C13 (his bold) by exactly the same amount per tonne of biomass generated"" "While that is true, Curtis's argument fails in his next statement:"Given that the total amount of biomass in the world is stable...". That is a false assumption, similar to the false CAGW assumption that climate is stable except for human interference. Curtis erroneously concludes that 'pseudo-critics' have no coherently worked out counter proposal that could attribute C13/C12 ratio changes to natural changes. This? is manifestly false, as I have pointed out to you previously." Rob Honeycutt @48, I was just looking through part of your debate with RealOldOne2, and noticed that you claimed I am a scientist. While flattered by the number of people who have made that assumption, it is not true . By training I am a philosopher, although my studies (both tertiary and private) have branched all over the place. Could I ask you to correct the record on Peter Sinclair's channel.
OP	Posted on Sep 24, 2012 We will all swallow our cup of corporate poison. We can take it from nurse Romney, who will tell us not to whine and play the victim, or we can take it from nurse Obama, who will assure us that this hurts him even more than it hurts us, but one way or another the corporate hemlock will be shoved down our throats. The choice before us is how it will be administered. Corporate power, no matter who is running the ward after January 2013, is poised to carry out U.S. history's most savage assault against the poor and the working class, not to mention the Earth's ecosystem. And no one in power, no matter what the bedside manner, has any intention or ability to stop it. If you insist on participating in the cash-drenched charade of a two-party democratic election at least be clear about what you are doing. You are, by playing your assigned role as the Democratic or Republican voter in this political theater, giving legitimacy to a corporate agenda that means your own impoverishment and disempowerment. All the things that stand between us and utter destitution -- Medicaid, food stamps, Pell grants, Head Start, Social Security, public education, federal grants-in-aid to America's states and cities, the Women, Infants, and Children nutrition program (WIC), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and home-delivered meals for seniors -- are about to be shredded by the corporate state. Our corporate oligarchs are harvesting the nation, grabbing as much as they can, as fast as they can, in the inevitable descent. We will be assaulted this January when automatic spending reductions, referred to as "the fiscal cliff," begin to dismantle and defund some of our most important government programs. Mitt Romney will not stop it. Barack Obama will not stop it. And while Romney has been, courtesy of the magazine Mother Jones, exposed as a shallow hypocrite, Obama is in a class by himself. There is hardly a campaign promise from 2008 that Obama has not broken. This list includes his pledges to support the public option in health care, close Guantanamo, raise the minimum wage, regulate Wall Street, support labor unions in their struggles with employers, reform the Patriot Act, negotiate an equitable peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, curb our imperial expansion in the Middle East, stop torture, protect reproductive rights, carry out a comprehensive immigration reform, cut the deficit by half, create 5 million new energy jobs and halt home foreclosures. Obama, campaigning in South Carolina in 2007, said that as president he would fight for the right of collective bargaining. "I'd put on a comfortable pair of shoes myself, I'll ... walk on that picket line with you as president of the United States of America," he said. But when he got his chance to put on those "comfortable pair of shoes" during labor disputes in Madison, Wis., and Chicago he turned his back on working men and women. Obama, while promising to defend Social Security, also says he stands behind the planned cuts outlined by his deficit commission, headed by Morgan Stanley board member Erskine Bowles and former Sen. Alan Simpson, a Wyoming Republican. The Bowles-Simpson plan calls for cutting 0.3 percentage points from the annual cost-of-living adjustment in the Social Security program. The annual reduction would slowly accumulate. After a decade it would mean a 3 percent cut. After two decades it would mean a 6 percent cut. The retirement age would be raised to 69. And those on Social Security who continued to work and made more than $40,000 a year would be penalized with further reductions. Obama's payroll tax cuts have, at the same time, served to undermine the solvency of Social Security, making it an easier target for the finance corporations that seek to destroy the program and privatize the funds. Advertisement But that is just the start. Cities and states are frantically staving off collapse. They cannot pay for most pension plans and are borrowing at higher and higher interest rates to keep themselves afloat. The country's 19,000 municipalities face steadily declining or stagnant property tax revenues, along with spiraling costs. Annual pension payments for state and local plans more than doubled to 15.7 percent of payrolls in 2011 from 6.4 percent a decade ago, according to a study by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College . And local governments, which made some $50 billion in pension contributions in 2010, face unfunded pension liabilities of $3 trillion and unfunded health benefit liabilities of more than $1 trillion, according to The Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government . State and local government spending fell at a rate of 2.1 percent in the second quarter of this year, according to the Commerce Department. It was the 11th consecutive quarterly reduction in expenditures. And in the past year alone local governments cut 66,000 jobs, mostly those of teachers and other school employees, reported The Wall Street Journal, which accumulated this list of grim statistics.

In article , Peter Jason wrote: A vacuum will hold up a column of water about 10 meters, so how does water get to the top of very tall trees? Peter The water isn't held up by vacuum (actually the external air pressure, not the vacuum per se) but by capillary action in series of very fine tubes. The cohesion of the water molecules to each other is what keeps the water up and rising as water evaporates from the periphery of the tree. N.B. This is why you cut off the bottom of flower stems before you put the bouquet in water. Thank you. I was also wondering why water evaporates more quickly from cotton (cellulosic) materials faster than from polyester, nylon, glass wool, and rubber foam etc. Indeed the difference is quite marked. As an experiment I put a petri dish on to a balance and in its center weighed a 1 gram piece of various substrates such as filter paper, cotton wool, cotton pajamas, nylon rope, glass wick, canvas, orlon and the like. In the center of these materials I placed 1gm of distilled water. In all cases the cellulose materials dried much faster than any other. Almost twice as fast. Strange, because this is the opposite I expected given the OH groups on the cellulose and their likely hood of their forming H-bonds with the water and so retaining it. EG a nylon shirt will dry faster than a cotton one, or so it seems though evidently the nylon article will contain less water when wet. I suggest you look at your samples both dry and wet with varying amounts of water under a low power microscope. Most of the fibers you list do not absorb water, so the limited amount of water you used just sits between the threads. THis causes a great deal less water surface to be exposed to air than if it is absorbed into cotton threads. Note that the diameter of the fibers of these materials and the tightness of the weave or twist are important factors and should be controlled for, as is the thickness or surface area to volume ratio of the samples. Also, what was your endpoint for determining that the sample was dry again? It should be the sample returning to a weight of 1 gram, and you should control for air motion, temperature and humidity. A nylon shirt will dry faster than a cotton one because it holds less water after being washed. You might want to experiment with weighing samples of various materials before and after being immersed in water and wrung, squeezed or spun out. You might be interested to examine wool fibers carefully both wet and dry. Like hair, they are covered with overlapping scales that remain from the cells they are composed of. Wool fibers absorb water and swell, trapping it. This explains why wool fabric is slow to dry and why it is unique in textile fibers for making garments that are warm even when they are wet. See if your library has any books on textiles and textile fibers. I've got a book I picked up at a rummage sale that is the text for a community college course in textile science, and the description of how synthetic and natural fibers are prepared, spun and woven is very interesting. Developments in the past few decades have made some surprising changes from the straightforward mechanization of techniques that go back for millennia. For example, weft fibers can be spun into thread by air currents as the fabric is woven in sealed looms, and non-woven textiles with a wide range of properties are becoming more common for both traditional and innovative uses.

NA	McCallum feels no pressure in Western Final By Monte Stewart The Canadian Press Share this Article VANCOUVER -- The Western Final will mark a unique anniversary for Paul McCallum. Playing for Saskatchewan in the 2004 West Final, the veteran kicker missed while attempting an 18-yard field goal attempt that would have given the Roughriders a berth in the Grey Cup. Instead, the host B.C. Lions prevailed and went on to win the title. McCallum was subsequently disowned by Rider fans and, after one more season in Regina, ended up moving back to the Lions, the team with which he had begun his unlikely CFL career. The miss could have destroyed McCallum's career. Instead, it made him better. "I wanted it not to define me," McCallum said Saturday after his club's final walkthrough at B.C. Place Stadium. "I made a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes, and I didn't want to be known for that mistake. You can come back and make a positive out of a negative. I think I've done that." There is little doubt he has. Heading into Sunday's contest against the Calgary Stampeders, he has made 39 of the 40 field goals he has attempted in the playoffs (semifinals, division finals and Grey Cup included) since 2006. His only miss came in last year's Grey Cup, which the Lions won anyway, over the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. "I'm pretty proud of that, but my career's not over, so I just want to keep going," he said. This season, McCallum has adjusted to a new holder in backup quarterback Mike Reilly and snapper in Angus Reid on field goals. They replaced former backup signal-caller Jarious Jackson, who was released and signed with Toronto in the off-season, and Dan McCullough, who retired. After some struggles adjusting to the newcomers, he established the same high level of trust and comfort that he felt with his former battery mates in a process that lasts a few seconds. McCallum finished the regular season with 44 field goals -- the highest total in the league -- off 52 attempts. His punts averaged 41.2 yards and his kickoffs travelled an average of 56.5. The field goal stats were down slightly from 2011, when he connected on 50-of-53 attempts. But the results defied the fact that at age 42, the Surrey, B.C., product is the oldest player in the CFL. "To me, I don't think age is an issue as far as I'm still here at that age," he said. "It's the fact that I'm still producing at that age." According to Don Sweet, a former CFL legend with the Montreal Alouettes who now tutors McCallum, the B.C. veteran's success has nothing to do with age. It's all about how smoothly he swings his leg, rhythm, tempo, and the ability to cast aside "voices" in his head that lead to extra pressure and distractions. "You have to have ice in your veins," said Sweet, when asked what it takes to be a good kicker. He rates McCallum as the CFL's all-time best, or at least on par with Lions legend Lui Passaglia, who played 25 seasons. As a divorced father of two girls aged 11 and 13, McCallum, who is also a residential real estate agent, could face plenty of distraction on and off the field. He attributes his strong focus to positive thinking and his thirst for pressure-packed situations. "I just think it's kind of your personality, your nature, your demeanour and things like that," said McCallum, adding he does not need to block anything out. "It's just something that I enjoy. I don't feel the same kind of pressure that, maybe, somebody else does. It's just something that I sort of thrive on, and I really enjoy that part of the game." He's been thinking about it for 20 seasons after his football career started seemingly by chance. The oldest of two sons of Scottish immigrants, he was not allowed to play the Canadian version of football while growing up. Instead, he played the traditional European version -- soccer. McCallum excelled with national and provincial teams as a youngster. He played with the Vancouver 86ers reserve team as well as a few friendlies with the parent Canadian Soccer League club (which was another name for what was, essentially, the Vancouver Whitecaps organization in the mid-to-late 1980s) and attempted to try his luck in Scotland at age 19. His cousin played professionally there and his uncle had connections with all the top teams. "At the time, I wasn't good enough," said McCallum. "It was one of those things where I was going to have to put a lot more time and effort in and stay there and work my way back up over there. I was told I could. I had the potential. But the life to me over in Europe wasn't good enough as it is over here. So being spoiled over here in North America, I gave it up and came home." A chance visit to a park to see friends led to him earning an invitation to kick for his local junior team, the Surrey Rams. It was early 1990s, and the Lions noticed him and brought him to B.C. Place for a private workout. On the ride home, then Lions player personnel director Bill Quinter told him he had the ability to become a CFL kicker if he wanted to. Having given up on his dream of a soccer career, he decided that he did. He trained with the Lions as a junior, signed as a free agent with Hamilton in 1993, but never played for the Tiger-Cats before playing briefly for the Lions, who still had Passaglia in his prime, Ottawa, B.C. again, a Scottish team in the World League of American Football, and then moving on to Saskatchewan. One season after his fateful miss, he signed as a free agent with the Lions in February 2006 and survived a challenge for his job from Sean Whyte, who has since been traded to Montreal. Now, with the 2004 miss having made him stronger and better, McCallum is not fazed by the possibility of being called in during the dying moments of Sunday's game to attempt a field goal necessary to keep the Lions' hopes of a second consecutive Grey Cup alive. "I try and approach them all the same way," he said. "I've gotta make them all."

Teens with smartphones are more likely to be sexually active, study suggests Teens with smartphones are more likely to be sexually active, study suggests According to a yet-to-be released study, teens with smartphones are more sexually active than those without, and likely to engage in risky behavior. In 2011, researcher Eric Rice and a team from the School of Social Work at the University of Southern California quizzed 1,839 students from the Los Angeles Unified School District about their sexual habits and their use of technology. According to the research, teens with smartphones are 1.5 times more likely to be sexually active than those without (47 percent compared to 35 percent), twice as likely to have been approached online for sex and twice as likely to have had sex with a partner they met on the internet. Those being asked for sex were also found to be having unprotected sex. Further, 17 percent said that an online stranger had asked them for sex. ?We?parents, health educators, physicians?must recognize that cell phones are yet another new way for adolescents to meet sex partners,? said USC researcher, Hailey Winetrobe. ?Parents and school health professionals should talk to their teens about being safe in meeting people online and in using condoms to prevent sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancies.?

Re: Teens with smartphones are more likely to be sexually active, study suggests First let me say my daughter has an iPhone paid for by her dad & I w as one of the parents I am talking about so I am not bashing on anyone. I've been on both sides of this. IMHO it has a lot more to do with parenting than it does with the phones. Parents who can afford to spoil their children also seem to pay less attention to what is going on with their kids. They try to buy them instead of raise them. When I had my daughter I did that with her. Her dad & I worked 168 hours every 2 weeks on the ambulance. We were away from her much more than we were home. We worked 7/24 hour shifts every 14 days. When we were off work we spoiled her with things but we were so tired & so busy trying to have "our lives" that she got very little of our time. That along with some other things ruined our marriage & we divorced. I married my wonderful hubby & shortly after my health got so bad I couldn't work but that was OK because I needed to care for his parents. Anyway the point of the whole thing is that money & my health & hubby's parents kept us at home most of the time. My daughter went from a wanna be wildchild into the whole goth thing to a wonderful Christian young lady. It's amazing what a little attention from the parents & a little less "stuff" can do for kids.
ID	2 Answers Universities that offer 'private' degrees (even if they are accredited) are never looked upon as favourably as a govt. sponsored education. This is fair and justifiable, the private institutions do everything to keep paying students on campus (which means it is difficult to fail). The govt. funded universities (like UWA) doesn't care if you fail, they have enough students. Singapore is the easy option, but getting a job afterwards will be more difficult. i did study at a private school here in singapore called informatics.. and hard to find a job.. since its not even recognized.. then i complained to ministry of education here, they said they overlook only the registration of schools.. and its my duty to check whether its recognized and can have placement of jobs after graduating.. i was too stupid to have chosen that private school.. as far as singapore is concerned, either you come here to study in a local school.. government universities or polytechnics.. other than that, dont come spend so much for private school and end up getting no job elsewhere in the world..
NA	Comments (90) Yes it is true the problem of violence in English history has not yet received the study it deserves, especially in the UK, but then I doubt few here will even wonder why the English seem so keen on bloodshed and abuse, much easier to look at the violence of the oppressed than question that. If we are not murdering people in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, we are teaching our children to admire such crimes in a historical context. Is it any wonder our young men like nothing better than to go into town on a Saturday night and beat the shit out of each other. On Tuesday night (the second night of serious disorder), Short Strand saw an influx of between 80-150 people from outside of the area. It was clear from the outset that these were supporters of dissident organisations. Sinn Fein had earlier blocked access to the grounds of St Matthews Chapel at Seaforde Street in an attempt to stop Nationalist youths becoming involved in direct confrontation with loyalists on Newtownards Road (as had happened on the Monday Night). This is why virtually all of the trouble on Tuesday night consisted of a direct battle between Loyalists and The PSNI on Newtownards Road. For the most part, Nationalists were kept well back by Republican stewards and community workers. At one point, dissident outsiders tried to break through the corden at St Matthews Chapel entrance on Seaforde Street and were told by local residents in no uncertain terms where they could get off, so to speak... Throughout the evening there were several direct confrontations between local residents who were trying to hold the peace and dissident youths. In one bizarre incident a large group of these outside dissident elements actually fell out with each other and a melee ensued. Eventually as the night wore on, the message finally got across and the dissidents finally left the area in a variety of cars and some on foot across the Albert Bridge towards the City Centre. Why do the great and the good look for all sorts of excuses for the violence, the Short Strand has been attacked by sectarian bigots since its inception. The reason for the attacks is simple, its pure unadulterated bigotry nothing else ! This bollox about attacks from the Short Strand area on Loyalists is a lie perpetrated to justify what has happened for century's. Call it as it is and stop pussy footing around it ! Oh by the way, my monthly cheque from the peace dividend came this morning, Peter and Marty both rang to make sure I received it and to see if there is anything else I'd like and all because I live in the Strand eh ! The PSNI blamed much of the trouble on a resurgent UVF in east Belfast now understood to be under the control of a new and renegade local commander. Hundreds of marshalled men have attacked homes and police in and around the nationalist enclave of Short Strand. Loyalist sources said that the trouble was mainly motivated by the UVF leader in east Belfast who is known by the nickname the "Beast from the East". The sources said he had resisted attempts by other UVF leaders to curb his powers... PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Alistair Finlay again blamed most of the trouble on the UVF. "Whether they have lost the influence to stop it, I don't know," he said. "But there certainly seems to be nothing to suggest that our position has changed, that the bulk of this violence is coming from the loyalist community and the UVF in east Belfast does have a role to play in that." Note, Mick Fealty @ 1:25 pm , a different "quality" paper. Self-evidently, that's not good enough. It's an "official" version, and the PSNI are a poisoned source. [irony alert!] So we insert the weaselling "allegedly" at will [thank you, AntrimObserver @ 10:13 am ]. So, it's got to be suspect number 2, the loose cannon: "dissident elements who had come into the area" [ keano @12:23 pm ] or "a new and renegade local commander" [that Irish Times report]. "Events, dear boy, events" (provided it's said in the proper tone) gets everyone off the hook: why am I thinking of Albert and the Lion : The manager wanted no trouble, He took out his purse right away, Saying 'How much to settle the matter?' And Pa said "What do you usually pay?'... The Magistrate gave his opinion That no one was really to blame And he hoped the Ramsbottoms Would add further sons to their name. That quickly segues into the line Anne Dawson is peddling for the Spectator [via the Slugger side-bar]: It's easy to dismiss the riots as sectarian violence -- but that's just a get-out clause for those who don't want to make the effort to deal with what's really going on in these dislocated and fractured communities. These are areas of high social and economic deprivation, inter-generational unemployment. Places where young people have no prospects, no hope. Paramilitaries are filling the vacuum that is left and intra-community feuding is rife. The one "explanation" that's not ever, anywhere accepted -- perish the thought! -- is the natural badness one. It couldn't possibly be we have become so attuned to resident evil and mayhem, we cannot give them up? --  Blood and destruction shall be so in use And dreadful objects so familiar That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war; All pity choked with custom of fell deeds...

What's that you celebrate on the 4th July? Winning a civil war? Native Americans and colonists on both sides? And let's not forget the Alamo!

When one group vandalizes or attacks home and property of the other in a close urban setting like this what do they get out of it? A thrill?

Malcolm, may i humbly refer you to the mans brief essay on the "Anglo-Saxon" (american appalachian variety). sez it all really Brian, there is financial gain, and the East Belfast UVF have obviously got their reward, keep watching for the West Belfast/North Belfast brigades finding a small nationalist community to get stuck into so they too can get a share of the 1st ministers pot of peace gold.

One is his curious and apparently incurable incompetence -- his congenital inability to do any difficult thing easily and well, whether it be isolating a bacillus or writing a sonata. The other is his astounding susceptibility to fears and alarms -- in short, his hereditary cowardice.... slappy, the rights campaign was a smokescreen initiated by those in the early 60s who wanted to sweep away the conservative administrations in Belfast and Dublin. You can go back to earlier rioting: "The Belfast riots of 1857, 1864 and 1886, and the Londonderry riots of 1869 and 1883, were the subject of commissions of inquiry... the formula for tinkering with the police was tried after each successive outbreak, and always without the slightest effect. The Irish Constabulary, the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Royal Ulster Constabulary were each in turn criticized for allowing riots to develop, and failing to contain them when they did develop. If they were unarmed, it was recommended that they should be armed; if they used their arms, it was recommended that they be disarmed." .. A T Q Stewart "What's that you celebrate on the 4th July? Winning a civil war? Native Americans and colonists on both sides? And let's not forget the Alamo! As a proportion of the population, the active participation of Hispanic native and immigrant residents in the struggle for independence of Texas from Spain and Mexico was equal to or greater in specific battles than that of resident immigrants from the United States of the North. http://www.celebratetexas.org/index.html " The 4th of July? There aren't any "loyalists" here. The descendants of those who were at the time are now as American in mind, body and spirit as rebellious to all things monarch is me. Next, the Alamo. The other side probably joins the march seeing as how the Alamo was a defeat for those commemorating the Alamo. Re Texas independence, well, a far cry from your circumstance. And for the irony that you probably have never appreciated, the Orange that you celebrate isn't local, it is the Orange worn by the Netherlands at the World Cup. King William of the House of Orange: "slappy, the rights campaign was a smokescreen initiated by those in the early 60s who wanted to sweep away the conservative administrations in Belfast and Dublin." From the relevant Cameron Report: 127. It will be convenient to deal first with the part which the sense of resentment and grievances unredressed played in the causation of these outbreaks. In order to assess this, it is necessary to consider whether and to what extent that sense was artificially engendered or stimulated, and also the degree to which it appears to have a substantial basis. The weight and extent of the evidence which was presented to us concerned with social and economic grievance or abuses of political power was such that we are compelled to conclude that they had substantial foundation in fact and were in a very real sense an immediate and operative cause of the demonstrations and consequent disorders after 5th October 1968. For this reason we took careful note of this very large body of evidence coming as it did from many individuals and organisations, and in a number of cases supported by statistics and documents themselves factual and not open to challenge on the score of their accuracy. At the same time we have to emphasise that it was not within our power or remit to conduct a detailed enquiry or form concluded judgments into or upon individual claims of discrimination or abuse of power by prevalent majorities in certain local authorities, and we seek to pass no judgment on the many specific and individual cases which were brought under our notice. These in so far as they relate to matters of genuine grievance would appear to fall appropriately within the jurisdiction of the proposed machinery for dealing with grievances against local authorities. We should record however that in the evidence presented to us from many responsible individuals and bodies, predominantly Protestant and non-Nationalist in purpose or outlook, there was a frank recognition that this widespread sense of grievance among Catholic people in Northern Ireland was justified in fact and called urgently for remedy. *** 134. The basic complaint in these areas is that the present electoral arrangements are weighted against non-Unionists. In the table on page 57 we show that the complaint is abundantly justified. In each of the areas with Unionist majorities on their council the majority was far greater than the adult population balance would justify. In Londonderry County Borough, Armagh Urban District, Omagh Urban District and County Fermanagh a Catholic majority in the population was converted into a large Unionist majority on the Councils. In the two Dungannon councils a very small Protestant majority held two-thirds or over of the seats on the councils. The most glaring case was Londonderry County Borough, where sixty per cent of the adult population was Catholic but where sixty per cent of the seats on the Corporation were held by Unionists. These results were achieved by the use, for example, of ward areas in which Unionist representatives were returned by small majorities, whereas non-Unionist representatives were returned by very large majorities. In Londonderry County Borough there was the following extraordinary situation in 1967: 135. The Commission asked several Unionist public representatives from the areas concerned to explain these electoral imbalances. They did not contest the general basis of the figures, but argued that the original arrangement of ward boundaries and local government had been based on rateable values as well as population, that population changes had upset arrangements which were originally fair, and that it was quite a frequent democratic situation (e.g., in United Kingdom national politics) for a small majority -- or even a minority -- to be translated by the electoral system into a large majority. 136. These arguments however ignore the realities of the local situation in Northern Ireland. It is obvious that local politics in these areas have always turned on questions of sectarian control and influence. There has never been anything resembling electoral swings from Conservative to Labour and back again. This is an important consideration. The electoral arrangement of wards tends inevitably to sterotype political representation without prospect of a change in the balance of political power by the 'swing of the pendulum'. The initial choice of ward areas effectively decided the permanent result of council elections. We note too that there have been times when other electoral systems and boundaries permitted non-Unionist majorities in Omagh Urban District, Armagh Urban District and Londonderry County Borough. Accordingly it is our view that the arguments used to justify the existing arrangements when they were introduced, mainly rationalised a determination to achieve and maintain Unionist electoral control. The Government's dissolution of Londonderry Corporation, and its replacement by a nominated Commission, was thus the most tangible victory of the initial Civil Rights campaign. *** 138. We are satisfied that all these Unionist controlled councils have used and use their power to make appointments in a way which benefited Protestants. In the figures available for October 1968 only thirty per cent of Londonderry Corporations administrative, clerical and technical employees were Catholics. Out of the ten best-paid posts only one was held by a Catholic. In Dungannon Urban District none of the Council's administrative, clerical and technical employees was a Catholic. In County Fermanagh no senior council posts (and relatively few others) were held by Catholics: this was rationalised by reference to 'proven loyalty' as a necessary test for local authority appointments. In that County, among about seventy-five drivers of school buses, at most seven were Catholics. This would appear to be a very clear case of sectarian and political discrimination. Armagh Urban District employed very few Catholics in its salaried posts, but did not appear to discriminate at lower levels. Omagh Urban District showed no clearcut pattern of discrimination, though we have seen what would appear to be undoubted evidence of employment discrimination by Tyrone County Council. Lastly, you can fool some of the people some of the time, but not all of the people all of the time. The "radical overthrow" theory was bandied about here by the same lot who preached "Segregation Now, Segregation Forever!". Most of us saw right through that and most see right through the late Mr. Stewart. So did the Cameron Report: 146. This catalogue of grievance deserves, in our judgment, to be seriously regarded in any analysis of the immediate causes of the disturbances. We disagree profoundly, having heard much evidence, with the view which professes to see agitation for civil rights as a mere pretext for other and more subversive activities. Truly lastly, the humans you mean are those People's Democracy folk. That would be Slugger's hero Eamonn McCann. Why he's Slugger's hero simply escapes my comprehension. So we may be on common ground in his regard. slappymcgroundout: The 4th of July? There aren't any "loyalists" here. The descendants of those who were at the time are now as American in mind, body and spirit as rebellious to all things monarch is me. Actually, the descendants are mostly Canadian, aren't they? Slappy, the Cameron Report was written in 1969 whereas the Desmond Greaves pamphlet was written about 1963. When you read O Comain's article you can probably appreciate why the Irish political establishment, the Catholic hierarchy and John Hume were more than a little concerned. It crosses my (as indicated by other denizens of this domain) very limited mind that Northern Ireland is remarkable, if not unique, for enthusiastically celebrating conquest by a foreign power. The way I read it, the events of 1688-92 could be seen as the third-and-a-half of the Anglo-Dutch Wars -- the one that the Dutch most decisively won. After all, the Dutch army kept London under "occupation" until 1690. It wasn't just Willem III & II that we got. All his hangers-on (all those "English" gentry and nobility with Van- and Vander- in their surnames) came along for the ride -- and stayed for the profits. Michael White? In the Torygraph ? My, my! Still, it has some of the White sparkle. This for those who need persuasion: According to Sellar and Yeatman's little book, which presumably still gets read under the desk in schools, 1066 and All That was a Good Thing that helped Britain to stop being conquered (as it had, until then, with some frequency) and become top nation. But the French think it a Good Thing for different reasons. And you don't realise how different until you go to Normandy and do the full William the Conqueror experience: a thing the Normans are encouraging this year, to celebrate 1,100 years of their existence. On the way, there are some shifts in terminology you will need to master. It's not William the Conqueror but Guillaume le Conqurant. And what he and his friends got up to isn't anything so brutish as the Norman Invasion but La Fabuleuse Epope -- which sounds like a cabaret act but translates as the Epic Adventure. If this weren't spin enough, at some point on the Guillaume trail you'll file along the 231 feet of the Bayeux Tapestry and reach a scene that reads: HAROLD SACRAMENTUM FECIT (Harold swears an oath). And it's this small but significant scene, with the Norman William looking blond and handsome while the English Harold looks as dodgy as a doorstep salesman, that explains a thousand or so years of Anglo-French mistrust. Yes, indeedy. And I did so enjoy Stephen Clarke's book on how we have enjoyed the relationship ever since. On those occasions when this English teacher found he had to "cover" a history class, he revelled in gentle subversion -- the kind of thing we all eschew in Sluggerdom. Ahem! Said English teacher found particular relish in noting that Guillaume-le-Btarde (to be fully enunciated, to the great delight of Year Seven) might have pressing reasons of personal esteem to become "William-the-Conqueror". On a really good day, a parent might telephone to complain -- cue the Sgt. Friday defence: "Just the facts, ma'am. Only the facts." It's the same old, same old, give us money to line our pockets with and f*** the people and area (just like in south east Antrim) only this time it's the UVF. Giving money to them will save them the hassle of drug dealing or extortion. Brian Feeney hit the nail on the head the other night on a UTV interview. I have been reading this site annon now for quite some time and am very impressed with the articulation and genuine understanding form members from across the divide. My reasoning for posting now is this. The Short Shand attack was planned that is undisputable now ask yourself a question the UVF in general have been under the microscope now for some time at the very highest level and it's fair to say that they are not flavour of the month. So do you really think that they would carry this and bring more attention and bad press upon them for no good reason over than sectarian bigotry and for kicks (what purpose does this serve) -- Well I can say with absolute certainly is that they didn't. Not that I'm a member but I am fully aware of the build-up that caused this. My mum lives at that interface and daily, weekly there is missiles being launched from the short strand matter of fact a ten year old girl was riding her bicycle recently and was struck on the head by a brick. Im not going to insult anyone's intelligence here and say there's been no attacks from the protestant side ie the paint bombing of the church etc but it is no way the same level at what's been happening from the strand -- this is orchestrated 100% The Provos and in particular Brendan Hughes ( I man I must admit have tremendous respect for) say they joined the movement after Bombay street to protect their community -- So please explain to me what is the difference between protestants defending themselves and Bombay street?? Jim Wilsons first interview was shambolic he basically came and said they these things happen because loyalist are left outside the process (more brains in a false face) but if anyone cared to listen to the minister on that same night after Jims interview he pointed out the real reasoning behind this and highlighted the on going attacks on protestant homes And as for this beast from the east -- you have all seen what the Loyalist community feels with what's happening at that interface so let's be a bit more factual before pointing fingers at anyone individual -- Not to mention the dissident bombings and shooting every chance they get so I guess there's a few rogues element's there which do not seem to be getting the same spotlight shown upon them -- the mainstream republicans may feel they have peace but for unionists we are not so sure. For Alex Maskey to say three is a problem on the protestant side that is our responsibility and to show leadership is completely laughable given what Is going on his own side. Practice what you preach Alex the dogs in the street now your organisation could shut those dissidents down at the drop of a hat if you really really wanted to. Of course you will deny this and tell people to go to the police etc but we all know this is empty words and nothing more and anyone who thinks otherwise is a fool. To be honest I don't really care if people try and ridicule this -- this is the truth as I know it simple coming that area. I hope it clears this up for anyone. And as for the PSNI reports pointing the finger completely as loyalists -- just out of interest. How many republicanism have been trailed into the HET or Asset Bureaus in comparison with the loyalist side?? With the exception of anyone who disagrees with the mainstream republicans (Gerry MeGeough for instance) This conflict is either over or its not if the government is going to go after ex combatants then at least have some degree of consistency or we will never move on. gtm2011 I live on the other side of the interface barrier, I'm not going to insult anyone by making up stories. There may well be attacks from the Short Strand on a daily basis which is wrong if true, speaking from my own experience there is not a day goes by whereby some missile or other comes over the wall at my home or my neighbours, golf balls and marbles are a regular, I have seen more golf balls than Rory McIlroy yet never played golf in my life! But, heres the crux, I would in no way seek to get even with the other side by organised attacks. The scenes we witnessed by last week when the UVF organised mass destruction of the area, have in my opinion set community relations back 10 yrs. The mistrust now in the Short Strand will be very difficult to remove, and the young people of both areas have sampled violence which everyone had thought we would never see again. There are almost daily excuses emanating from Loyalist for the violence, none of which stand up to scrutiny or can be justified, what happened was wrong end of story. As for the HET and assets recovery, are you suggesting that Loyalists under investigation should be given immunity for their criminal acts ? and if the are not are we to witness more of the same by the UVF ? If thats the case we are destined to be forever in the mire of conflict, I wouldn't wish that to be the case, do you ? Victor no-one wants to go back to what we had before I can honestly say that the area do feel under attack and it was simply a push to far -- I do believe you when you say youre experiancing the same kind of issues on your side of the fence. After the talks things have settled down and hopefully people will pull their horns in and get back to living in peace. Both sides were wrecked and caused a lot of damage. My point being with HET and assest etc is that if there are investigations then it should also apply to republicans and I mean mainstream republicans also as it does seem to be all one way traffic both sides were and are involved in criminal acts but very very few from a republican background are being targeted in the same way as loyalists this cannot be disputed. We have government officals who are heading the state who we all know were involved in some sort of criminalty throughout the conflict so it does seem rather contradictory that some get a get out of jail free card while others are being pursured and held accountable it has to be more fair right across the board. gtm2011 The HET issue is a perception, you miss the point that the vast majority of people convicted or imprisoned during the conflict were Republican maybe thats why those Loyalists who were given free reign during the conflict are being perused now. Besides that, what has that got to do with the people in the Short Strand ? attacking the Short strands going to stop HET enquiries is it ? Another issue regarding the HET is evidence, given that Loyalists were operated by Special branch and are overflowing with informers, the HET have little problems gaining information on those organisations, therefore pursuing them is a simple task, it may not be so on the Republican side. The HET is not a perception its a fact look at the figures, secondly the Provos were infiltrated at the highest level (even though they like to tell everyone they werent) so im sure theres evidence there if governmnet wish ti use it im sure the likes of Dennis Donaldson, Stakeknike must have given them quite more than car reg numbers over the years. Attacks on Protestant homes? We have established that both sides suffered similar attacks, therefore it cannot be that. HET enquiries into Loyalist attacks? Nothing whatsoever to do with the Short Strand therefore it cannot be that! Assets recovery taking criminal assets from Loyalists? Nothing whatsoever to do with Short Strand residents, therefore it cannot be that! Financial reward to those in the UVF who organised the attacks? Hasn't been established but is in the mix as the major factor! Pure unadulterated bigotry? Again another major factor, highly probable, but likely a partial excuse. UVF leadership in East Belfast seeking to gain control? Another probable and again likely to be partial rather than solely responsible! And the facts! Nothing can excuse the behaviour of the organised Loyalists assault on the Short Strand. Those seeking to excuse their vile behaviour are as guilty as those in the masks, there are no excuses, it's that simple! Look Im not saying that HET etc is why the trouble flared im saying there seems to relentless blame, persecution on loyalists at every chance this being one of them the PSNI were all over the loyalists on this trouble but didnt once mention the constant attacks in the area leading up to the riots of whihc thye have been reported each and every time even when asked about the shooting they were very clear in saying it was the UVF who fired but when asked who fired from the strand they say they didint know -- yeah right Look I think we've both got our own Ideas and thoughts here so im leaving this alone now.
NA	An Invitation to Make a Difference Today's Reflection is about an opportunity -- and an invitation -- to make a difference, of a specific kind, this holiday season. Sandra, a student in a Coaching for Leadership course at Royal Roads University, shares the following story. In this course, students practice coaching each other in triads (among many other learning processes), while periodically being audited and assessed by the course instructor; the story she shares follows her experience after the first audited teleconference call. It's the year 2001 and I take my son to the ice rink to try skating for the first time. He is so excited. At five years of age he has already determined that he wants to play in the National Hockey League. As I tied his skates he was grinning from ear to ear, and eager to get onto the ice. As we approached the edge of the ice I asked him if he'd like a support bar to help him skate. He pushed past me saying that he didn't need one. In his mind he could already skate... so why would he need support? With reservation, I led him to the edge of the ice. With confidence he stepped out on to the ice with great expectations... He fell flat on his back. Good thing he had a helmet on. A look of horror washed over his face, and he broke into a flurry of tears. I gently scooped him up and carried him off the ice. I sat holding him struggling between my own tears and feelings of laughter. How could he be so naive to think he could skate without being taught, and without practice? It was sad, silly, and heart wrenching all at the same time. With some gentle persuasion and a whole lot of love I coaxed him back onto the ice with a support bar. He struggled, but after a half-hour I could see that he was beginning to get some satisfaction from the experience. Eight years later... he skates like the wind. He's powerful, confident, and light on his feet. He makes it look so easy and he loves it so much. NHL or not, skating has enriched his life. Only from guidance, practice and perseverance has he been able to become such a skilled and valued defense man. After our triad coaching call, I felt a lot like I'd fallen flat on my back. Afraid that I had not done my best, and afraid to try again. Wondering if coaching is really something I have an inclination for, and if it can bring value to me and those around me. Full of self doubt, I wasn't feeling very positive about my attempt to 'skate.' During a quick run yesterday, I was struck by the similarities of these situations. Why do I believe that I should be able to coach someone without being taught? I have been working on reframing my perspective to believe that with guidance, practice and perseverance, I can become a much better coach. "Who are you?" said the Caterpillar. "I -- I hardly know, Sir, just at present", Alice replied rather shyly, "at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then." -- Lewis Carroll Such is the nature of learning, a journey with a destination that often ends up being very different from where we thought we would end up. The importance of support along the way cannot be underestimated; any place worth going is not worth going alone. Somehow, today the story above resonates more with the theme of "support" for me. Whether it is the influence of the holiday season, or the invitation below, I am thinking of supporting and serving and of contributing. Please share this message far and wide, because such simple action can also make a difference. "Shadow and Light exist in the same universe. We don't have to choose. The shadow is sharpest when the light is brightest." -- anonymous I think many of us realize that we do live in challenging times, likely at a tipping point in our world's history. From global warming, to social injustice, to corporate greed, to extinction of species, to ecological disasters, to eradication of tribal ways of life, to... unfortunately, the list can be very long. Luckily, so are the attempts and actions of many people all over the world to make a difference, to take action, to fight for the plant and ALL its inhabitants. One of the places I want to mention here is Bainbridge Graduate Institute (BGI), which is a school for MBA in Sustainable Business on Bainbridge Island, just outside of Seattle. Given that businesses are one of the key factors in the negative impacts through their actions (and some would argue that businesses are THE key factor), it only makes sense to focus on this direction to make a profound difference. This is what BGI is all about -- changing business thinking at the core, changing the thinking and the actions of hundreds of companies and dozens of business schools. Changing business for good. Watch this short, 3-minute video , to get a better sense of what BGI is all about, as described by the BGI president. Or, this 7-minute BGI Program Overview clip . Or, think of what one graduate, who heads the Corporate Social Responsibility department at the billion-dollar retailer REI, put it: "What passes for a casual coffee conversation at BGI is treated as genius at REI." Right now, BGI needs help. BGI needs your help because other schools are coming and asking for help building sustainability into their curriculum and BGI needs the finances to respond. BGI needs help with accreditation because even though it is going very well it is taking up a lot of time and resources. BGI also needs help because the school is growing. It has already grown from 14 to 200 students and tuition only covers 70% of our costs. Your contribution will help BGI address these issues and help bring BGI into the mainstream of business education. And make a difference. So this part of the newsletter is an invitation and a request for help. It can take many different forms, whether by donating (via a link here ), by sharing this message with many others everywhere, and anything else you can think of. Any action of yours will be of support to BGI, to change business for good, and make a difference for our collective future.

BS of Barrow in Furness - December 2007 I would like to send you a sincere and heartfelt thank you for the service you have given me recently. I have used only your company for any car hire I have needed over the past few months... and that has included my visits to Los Angeles ( twice ), Hawai'i , New York, and most recently Switzerland... and I have to say that the service i received over the past few days has been quite exceptional. I am travelling to Switzerland today and only discovered that I needed to hire a car yesterday. The care and attention I was given was amazing. I was treated with real care and concern, even though it was such a late booking.... and needless to say, the arrangements were perfect and my worries about getting the voucher in time were not necessary. Again, I want to say a big big thank you for the service that was provided. PB of Norfolk -- November 2007 As always you fix whats wrong. Thanks for your very quick action.

AB of Scotland - November 2007 Please also note again that I was very pleased throughout by your level of service and by the no nonsense reply to my first query about driving on unpaved roads. You remain a credit to the often discredited business of car hire. DC of Inverness -- November 2007 I just wanted to thank you for the prompt service you provided regarding the car rental last week which was at such short notice. It all worked out perfectly.

IN	Brazil: country of the future, or has its time come? Brazil's economy has grown and receded in recent years. Adjustments in economic and social policies are now needed to make the country more competitive and increase its growth potential, writes Ins Filipa Brazil has always been considered the country of the future. With a large, low-income consumer market, and a wide variety of industrial and natural resources, Brazil's promise lies in the ability of its government to control inflation and strengthen the economy. In the last 20 years, it has undergone major economic reform, leading to price stability, increased purchasing power and investment-grade status. The stabilisation process began in the 90s with the Real Plan, followed by a re-organisation of public administration, and the privatisation of vital sectors such as energy, telecommunications, mining and banking. In this period (1994-2007), the country went through a severe international crisis, exacerbated by a lack of infrastructure, and suffered speculative attacks against real and internal problems, such as the energy crisis. Even so, despite all the adversity and some inflation spikes due to external shocks, the stabilisation process was consolidated. The inflation-targeting regime introduced in 1999 has been fundamental to the stabilisation of inflation, and resulted in substantial adjustments to the official Selic rate (the central bank's overnight lending rate) to keep inflation below the target ceiling. As a consequence, Brazil has experienced big swings in GDP growth, which to some extent has mitigated the sustained growth in domestic investment (which was needed to make the country stronger and growth more sustainable). Even so, the country has modernised its public administration, and finally appears to have stabilised -- a development that helped it secure investment-grade status. Another relevant process introduced by the government has been an upgrading of the minimum wage, which raised the income of the poorest and allowed the consumer market to expand. In the 2008 crisis the government and the Central Bank were forced to provide a strong stimulus to the economy through fiscal and monetary policies. These measures boosted the labour market and strengthened domestic demand, the principal driver behind the country's 7.5 percent GDP growth in 2010. The subsequent downswing in GDP growth in 2011 was to a large extent a response to policy measures introduced to contain rising inflation. Brazil's growth potential is estimated between 4.0 and 4.5 percent, a rate that was predicted for the year 2011, but is being revised to between 3.0 and 3.5 percent. A volatile market The curious thing about Brazil is that its economy can move through extremes in a very short period of time. It appears very responsive to the fiscal/monetary policy mix which can produce a strong acceleration or reversal of growth from quarter to quarter. Although the country still maintains strong domestic demand, the industrial sector has been losing strength in recent years due to the impact of an unfavourable exchange rate on the export sector; greater uncertainties about both the domestic and global economy; low investment, high interest rates and inflation; and strong competition from imports. Even with GDP growth below potential expected for this year, the prospects for Brazil are positive. The central bank has eased its monetary policy stance, the labour market has strengthened and the consumer market still shows plenty of potential to grow further. The economy is heading towards maturity and has achieved much in the last two decades. Brazil's high interest rate environment, compared to other emerging countries, reflects a number of factors: the lack of infrastructure, low private investment, low external competitiveness in some industries, outdated regulation, low employee productivity, a wide variety of taxes (and high rates), and low investment in technology and education. The country needs to shake off these shackles to complete the transition from an emerging to a fully developed economy -- but much of this journey has been completed. the future is now The future has arrived for Brazil. We are an economy that is heading towards maturity, having achieved a stable economy and modern society in just two decades -- but more is needed. It takes a long-term plan to correct deficiencies that were only corrected in the short term and need to be improved. Brazil is an active economy, earning the respect of its partners. The country needs to shake off the shackles that prevent the reduction of interest that keeps inflation down every time the country is growing rapidly and well above potential. Adjustments in economic and social policies are still needed to make the country more competitive and increase growth potential. The country still needs to take important steps, taking advantage of its stronger economic base. We need to take action to secure our move from an emerging economy to a developed one, but we still need major renovations, an expansion of technology, and foreign investors mindful of our unique investment opportunities.

Despite the financial crisis of 2008, ICAP has closed its fiscal year with record revenues of 1.5bn.

Today, ICAP has also become a major broker in the Brazilian market in equities, futures, foreign exchange, bonds, commodities and energy. Top 5 Norway Norway taxes motor fuels twice, with a road use tax and a CO2 emissions tax. Combined with strikes in the energy sector that have curbed output, the price of gas at a local pump has soared to $10.12 per gallon. Turkey Though Turkey sits on the Suez Canal and neighbours many oil rich countries, the price of a gallon of average gas clocks in at $9.41 in Turkish pumps, because of a 60 percent share of taxes. Israel Like Turkey, Israel is surrounded by oil-rich neighbours, but drills very little itself. Gas prices are controlled by the government, so about half of the $9.28 per gallon goes to taxes. Hong Kong There are few gas stations in Hong Kong, but the ones available charge up to 76 percent more per gallon than mainland China, where the government caps the cost of fuel. A gallon at the pumps will cost around $8.61 on the island. Netherlands Expensive labour costs make the Dutch petrol prices the dearest in Europe, at $8.26 per gallon; though the 57 percent tax add-ons don't help.

With the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the domino effect of irresponsible public monetary policies, huge levels of unsustainable debt, and a deregulated financial sector, has escalated to the point where no corner of the globe has been left untouched. 1973 oil crisis October 1973 Syria and Egypt launch an attack on Israel on Yom Kippur and set off a twenty day war; 1977 US President Carter creates Department of Energy, which develops the US strategic petroleum reserve The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) used their oil reserves as a weapon with the Arab Oil Embargo against those who supported Israel. By January 1974, world oil prices were four times higher than they were at the start of the crisis, especially in the US, and the shock led to a huge drop in the stock market with NYSE losing $97bn in just six weeks.  The embargo lasted five months, and the effects are still seen today. German hyperinflation 1922-1923 Hyperinflation 1923 -- 1924 Stabilisation The trouble began when Germany missed a repatriation payment, worth about one third of the German deficit in this period. Inflation was already high but by 1923 it was raging. Prices doubled within hours, and by late 1923, it cost 200bn marks to buy a single loaf of bread. People burned money as it was cheaper than buying firewood. Germany eventually regained control of its economy when it introduced the Rentenmark into circulation in 1923, and then the Reichmark in 1924. The Great Depression 1929-1933 The Great Crash 1934-1939 Recovery and Recession After the decadence of the Roaring Twenties, the 1930s saw the biggest economic slump of all time. The stock market crashed on 29 October 1929, and optimism and decadent living tumbled along with the figures. The GDP fell from $103.6bn in 1929, to $66bn in 1934 and the subsequent years of recovery were the most dramatic in US history. 1907 bankers' panic 1907 Otto Heinze and his brother Augustus Heinze bought shares of United Copper. The stock market was already cautious over the tight money supply, but the US was thrown into a depression after the stock market fell nearly 50 percent from its peak in 1906. The Heinze brothers thought they could influence market shares but ended up bankrupting lenders that provided the financing to buy the stock. A chain reaction left nine institutions bankrupt. By February 1908, the panic was over and the government created the Federal Reserve system, to prevent banks from exercising too much control over the economy. Top five... Financial crises of all time World Finance looks at some of history's largest financial catastrophes.
IN	Cattle that have been refused passports Every bovine animal in the United Kingdom has a unique number, which is shown both on ear tags and in a cattle passport. By law all cattle must be registered on the Cattle Tracing System (CTS) by applying for a valid cattle passport to the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS). An application for a cattle passport must be received by BCMS within a total of 27 days from birth (with the exception of bison). If an application for a cattle passport is declined, in the first instance you should consider appealing against the BCMS's refusal to issue passports. Grounds for appeal are limited but you will need to show that there were exceptional circumstances that stopped you making the application on time. Cattle without passports, both male and female, cannot be moved off your holding alive except under licence and only to an approved sampling site. The cattle, if under 48 months old, can be shot on the farm and removed under licence to a knacker's yard, hunt kennel, rendering or incinerator plant. If over 48 months they will need to be tested for BSE. This applies to both male and female animals. In the guide Cattle identification Applying for cattle passports What can I do with cattle that do not have passports? Penalties Cattle identification The Cattle Identification Regulations 2007 require that every bovine animal in the United Kingdom (as elsewhere in the European Union) has a unique number, shown both on an ear tag in each ear and on a paper cattle passport which is held by the current keeper of the animal (this system covers both cattle and other bovine animals such as water buffalo and bison). The unique number and passport remain with the animal throughout its life and any movements of cattle are recorded both on the paper passport and electronically on a national system administered by the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) . Such a system is important because: it supports the control and eradication of bovine diseases, for example, tuberculosis (TB) and foot and mouth disease (FMD) it protects consumers by ensuring that products going into the human food chain are fully traceable and as safe to eat as possible Applying for cattle passports Applications for cattle passports must be made to the BCMS . Applications for passports can be made to BCMS in Workington in five ways: through CTS Online CTS Web Services from some farm software packages using an agent using the pre-printed application form sent automatically when an order for eartags is confirmed (if you regularly register your cattle births electronically, BCMS have stopped automatically issuing pre-printed passport applications forms with your ear-tag orders) Self Service Line (SSL) - the BCMS automated telephone system All applications for cattle passports must be made to the BCMS within seven days of tagging (a maximum of 27 days in total from date of birth). Keepers of cattle must ensure that passport applications are made within the time limits allowed and ensure that movement records, both in the passport and in registers are kept up to date. Passport applications may be refused by BCMS if you apply late. If so, the animal(s) will be registered on the CTS and you will receive a notice of registration (CPP35). The animal(s) will not be eligible for slaughter for human consumption and cannot be sold or moved from the holding except under licence to a hunt kennel or knacker's yard. It is an offence under the Cattle Identification Regulations 2007 not to register cattle within the legal time limits, (in other words, not to apply for a passport). What can I do with cattle that do not have passports? In the first instance you should consider appealing against BCMS' refusal to issue passports. Grounds for appeal are limited but you will need to provide evidence to show that there were exceptional circumstances that stopped you making the application on time, for example: ostal delays - this is a common reason for appeal but BCMS will require independent evidence, such as a certificate of posting (you are advised to ask for a certificate of posting for any paper applications) those outside your control ('acts of God') such as: major floods, regional or national power failures, or postal strikes ersonal circumstances including a death in the family, a sudden serious illness, and theft of or damage to your farm records or computer mistakes made by BCMS or a breakdown of CTS The following are not grounds for appeal: a mistake, oversight or misunderstanding by you or anyone acting for you It is imperative that if you are going to appeal, you do so immediately. BCMS may issue a cattle passport outside the specified time but only if it is satisfied about the animal's identity and that all the information in the application is accurate. This can be based on a DNA test, which proves that the animal or the offspring of the dam shows in the application. Further information on appeals of DNA testing can be obtained from the BCMS telephone helpline: 0845 0501234 or refer to the cattle keeper's handbook . Cattle, both male and female, without passports cannot be moved off your holding alive. The cattle (if under 48 months old) can be shot on the farm and removed under licence to a knacker's yard, hunt kennel, rendering or incinerator plant. Carcasses from cattle aged over 48 months, not intended for human consumption, will need to be tested for BSE. Cattle keepers must contact a collector within 24 hours of death to arrange delivery to an approved sampling site. If delivering the carcasses themselves, they should contact an approved sampling site to agree to this within 24 hours and must deliver the carcase within a further 48 hours, contact your normal collector or the National Fallen Stock Company (NFSCo) on 0845 054 8888. Female cattle can be used as milking or suckler cows and their calves are eligible for passports. Cows used in this way at the end of their commercial life will have no value and will have to be put down on farm and dealt with as mentioned above. Male cattle (except for a bull kept for breeding purposes) have no value and should be shot and disposed of as animal by-products as soon as possible to avoid the cost of keeping them and the subsequent disposal cost. In financial terms the sooner the cattle are slaughtered the lower the cost which will be incurred by you. It is in your interest to have these animals slaughtered without delay. You may be required by Defra or local authority inspectors to account for all the cattle on your holding that have been refused passports. Penalties If you move a live animal that does not have a cattle passport off your holding, without a licence, it is a criminal offence. The maximum penalty on conviction in a magistrate's court is a fine of 5,000 and/or three months' imprisonment. The maximum penalty on conviction in the crown court is a 5,000 fine and two years' imprisonment.
